<p><cite>Later on, I found you in the drawing-room of a

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lawyer opened a door. Thérèse
Desqueyroux, as she stood in that remote corridor
of the law-courts, felt the fog upon her face and
inhaled it deeply. She was afraid some one
might be waiting for her, and hesitated to go out.
A man with his coat collar turned up appeared
from the shadow of a plane tree, and she recognised
her father.</p>

<p>“All right,” cried the lawyer; “case dismissed”;
and, turning to Thérèse, he added,
“You can go out now; no one is there.”</p>

<p>She went down the damp steps; the little
Square seemed indeed deserted. Her father did
not kiss her, did not even look at her. He asked
a few questions of Duros, the lawyer, who
answered in low tones, as though he were afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of being overheard. She just managed to catch
what they were saying.</p>

<p>“I shall get the official notification to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I suppose nothing can go wrong now?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing; it’s all over.”</p>

<p>“I suppose after my son-in-law’s statement, it
was a certainty?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not so sure.... You never can
tell.”</p>

<p>“But after he’d said definitely that he had
not counted the drops....”</p>

<p>“My dear Larroque, in affairs of this kind the
victim’s evidence....”</p>

<p>Here Thérèse broke in; “But there wasn’t
any victim.”</p>

<p>“I meant by victim, the victim of his own
imprudence, Madame.”</p>

<p>The two men stared at her for a moment as
she stood there motionless, wrapped in her cloak,
and looked curiously at her expressionless face.
She asked where the carriage was; her father had
arranged for it to wait on the Budos road, outside
the town, so as not to attract attention.</p>

<p>They crossed the Square, where leaves from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the plane trees were sticking to the rain-soaked
benches. Fortunately the days had grown much
shorter: besides, to get to the Budos road, they
could go through the most unfrequented streets
of the little provincial town. Thérèse walked
between the two men (she was nearly half a
head taller than either of them), and they began
a further discussion as if she had not been there;
but finding the intervening feminine presence
inconvenient they began unconsciously to elbow
her out of the way. She accordingly dropped
a little behind, and took the glove off her left
hand so as to be able to pick the moss off the
ancient stone walls at her side. From time to
time a workman on a bicycle, or a trap came
past, and she drew close in to the houses to
avoid being splashed with mud. But Thérèse
was hidden by the gathering dusk, and no one
recognised her. The smell of fog and baking
bread was for her not merely the usual evening
smell of a little town; it was the perfume of
the life that had been restored to her at last.
She shut her eyes to savour the moist leafy
fragrance of the sleeping earth, and tried not to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
listen to the words of the short bandy-legged
gentleman who did not once turn his head
towards his daughter. She might have fallen at
the roadside and neither he, nor Duros, would
have noticed it. They were no longer afraid to
raise their voices.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Desqueyroux’s statement was all
that could be desired, but there was that <span class="lock">prescription,—in</span>
point of fact, it was a question of
forgery. And it was Doctor Pédemay who had
brought the charge....”</p>

<p>“But he withdrew it.”</p>

<p>“I know; but her <span class="lock">explanation—this</span> mysterious
individual who handed her a prescription....”</p>

<p>Thérèse walked more slowly, not because she
was tired, but to get out of earshot of these
phrases that had been dinned into her brain for
so many weeks; but it was no use. She could
not help hearing her father’s raucous accents:</p>

<p>“I told her over and over again that she <em>must</em>
try to think of something else.”</p>

<p>He was quite right, he had indeed said so very
often. But what was he worrying about now?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
What he called the honour of the name, was
safe: the whole story would have been forgotten
by the time of the Senatorial elections, Thérèse
thought to herself, as she did her best not to
catch up the two men; but in the heat of the
discussion, they stopped, gesticulating at each
other, half-way down the street.</p>

<p>“My advice to you, Larroque, is to face the
thing out: take the offensive in next Sunday’s
<cite>Semeur</cite>: I’ll see about it if you like. Get them
to put in a notice headed ‘An Infamous Rumour’
or something like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you, my dear fellow: as a
matter of fact there is no case to answer, the
prosecution obviously had not a leg to stand on;
they did not even consult hand-writing experts.
I am sure the best thing will be to say nothing,
and hush it all up. I will do what is necessary
and I won’t spare expense: we can’t afford to
have any scandal, for the sake of the family.”</p>

<p>They had walked on again by this time, and
Thérèse did not hear Duros’ answer. She inhaled
the damp night air once more as though
she were afraid of choking; and suddenly there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
came before her mind the unknown face of her
maternal grandmother Julie Bellade: it was indeed
unknown, for neither the Larroque nor the
Desqueyroux families possessed a single likeness
of her, and nothing was known about her except
that she had one day disappeared. Thérèse
realised that she too might have been wiped
out of existence, and later on not even her little
daughter Marie would have been allowed to find
in an album the likeness of one who had brought
her into the world. At that moment Marie
was already asleep in a room at Argelouse, where
Thérèse would arrive late that evening: she
would listen in the darkness to the murmur
of that childish slumber; she would lean over
the bed and her lips would drink in the sweetness
of that sleeping life like a draught of clear
water.</p>

<p>The carriage stood waiting by the ditch at the
edge of the road; the hood was raised and the
two lamps lit up the skinny hind quarters of the
horses. Beyond it towered two dark walls of
forest. The tops of the lower tiers of pines on
either side met overhead, and the road vanished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
into the darkness under that dim archway.
Above it gleamed the sky, fretted by a network
of myriad branches.</p>

<p>The coachman watched Thérèse with greedy
curiosity. When she asked him if they would
get to Nizan station in time to catch the last
train, he said they would if they started at once.</p>

<p>“I shall not need to trouble you again,
Gardère.”</p>

<p>“Has Madame no more business here, then?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, while the man still devoured
her with his eyes. Would she be looked
at like that for the rest of her life?</p>

<p>“Well, are you glad?” asked her father. He
seemed at last to have noticed her presence.
Thérèse glanced at that sallow bilious countenance,
those cheeks bristling with a coarse growth
of whitish-yellow hair, so painfully distinct in
the light of the carriage lamps.</p>

<p>“I have suffered so much,—I am worn
out ...” she began, in low tones; but she soon
relapsed into silence. It was no use talking; he
was not listening, he was not even looking at her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
He cared very little about Thérèse’s feelings.
One thing and one thing only mattered to him;
his upward progress to the Senate might be impeded
and even endangered by this wretched
daughter of his: all women, in his opinion, were
either hysterical or stupid. Fortunately her
name was no longer Larroque: she was a
Desqueyroux. Now that they had managed to
avoid a trial at the Assizes, he breathed again:
but it would be difficult to prevent his enemies
keeping the wound open. He would go and see
the Prefect the very next day. Thank Heaven,
he could do what he liked with the Editor of the
<cite>Lande Conservatrice</cite>. There was that story about
those little girls!... He took Thérèse’s arm:</p>

<p>“Get in at once, you’ve no time to lose.”</p>

<p>Then the lawyer, perhaps out of malice, or
possibly not liking to let Thérèse go without saying
a word to her, asked if she was going back to
Monsieur Bernard Desqueyroux that very evening.
As she replied, “Of course I am; my
husband is expecting me,” she realised for the
first time since she had left the Law Courts that
she would, in fact, in a few hours, cross the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
threshold of the room in which her husband was
lying, still rather ill, and that this was the beginning
of an indefinite succession of days
through which she must live in this man’s
company.</p>

<p>She had been staying with her father, just
outside the little town, while the case had been
under investigation, but she had, of course, often
made this journey; on the previous occasions,
however, she had been intent upon the necessity
for giving her husband an exact account of what
had happened, and her mind was full of Duros’
last words of advice, as she had got into the
carriage, on the answers Monsieur Desqueyroux
was to make when he was again questioned.
Thérèse had then felt no distress or awkwardness
at finding herself face to face once more with
the sick man: what they had to consider was not
what had really happened, but what they had
better say, or not say. Husband and wife had
never been so closely united as they were by the
preparation of this <span class="lock">defence,—drawn</span> together
across the infant body of their little daughter
Marie. They concocted, for the judge’s benefit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
a simple and coherent story, calculated to convince
that logical mind. She used to get into
the same carriage that was waiting for her this
evening: but to-night she dreaded the end of
that journey through the darkness which in those
days she had found so tedious. She remembered
how, the moment she got into the carriage, she
longed to be back in that room at Argelouse,
and she used to go over in her mind the instructions
she was to pass on to her husband: he
was to be sure, for instance, to say that she had
told him one evening about that prescription
which an unknown man had asked her to take to
the chemist’s, on the pretext that he did not like
to go himself because he owed money <span class="lock">there,—but</span>
Duros did not advise that Bernard should
go so far as to pretend that he remembered
remonstrating with his wife for doing such a
foolish thing.</p>

<p>Now that the nightmare had been exorcised,
what would Bernard and Thérèse talk about that
evening? She saw in her mind’s eye the desolate
house in which he was awaiting her: she pictured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the bed in the centre of that stone-floored room,
and the lamp, turned low, standing on a table
among a litter of newspapers and medicine bottles.
The house-dogs, awakened by the noise of
the carriage, bark and are quiet: and then the
silence would descend once more, the awful
silence of those nights when the wretched
Bernard lay racked by frightful paroxysms of
vomiting. Thérèse tried to imagine the first moment,
not far distant now, when their eyes would
meet; and then the ensuing night, the next day,
the day after, and the weeks to come, in that
house at Argelouse, where they would no longer
need to compose a presentable version of the
drama they had lived. There would be nothing
now between <span class="lock">them,—except</span> what had really been
there, really, and in very truth. Thérèse lost her
nerve, and stammered, turning towards the
<span class="lock">lawyer,—though</span> her words were intended for
the older man:</p>

<p>“I expect to stay a few days with Monsieur
Desqueyroux, and then, if he goes on improving,
I shall come back to my father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Not a bit of it, my dear,” said Monsieur
Larroque, and as Gardère began to fidget on his
seat, he added, lowering his voice: “Have you
taken leave of your senses? You can’t possibly
leave your husband at such a time. You must
be <span class="lock">inseparable,—inseparable,</span> I tell you, for the
rest of your lives.”</p>

<p>“Of course, father: what could I have been
thinking of? Then you will come to
Argelouse?”</p>

<p>“But I shall expect you over for the fair on
Thursdays as usual, Thérèse. You will go on
coming as you always did.”</p>

<p>She must surely understand that any departure
from existing usages would be fatal. She
must realise that, once and for all. He felt sure
he could depend upon her, she had done the
family enough harm already.</p>

<p>“You must do exactly what your husband tells
you, and then you won’t go far wrong.”</p>

<p>And he hurried her into the carriage.</p>

<p>Thérèse noticed the lawyer’s outstretched
hand, with its coarse dark nails:</p>

<p>“All’s well that ends well,” said he, and indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
he really meant it. If the case had gone any
further he would not have got much out of it.
The family would have called in Maître
Peyrecave of the Bordeaux Bar: so everything
was for the best.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thérèse</span> loved the musty leathery smell of
old carriages: and she did not mind having left
her cigarettes behind, for she hated smoking in
the dark. The carriage lamps lit up the sloping
banks each side of the road, a strip of ferns and
undergrowth, and the feet of the giant pines.
At intervals, heaps of stones by the wayside cut
across the moving shadow of the carriage. Sometimes
a country cart passed them, and the mules
instinctively moved to the right-hand side of the
road without a sign from the sleeping muleteer.
Thérèse began to feel that she would never reach
Argelouse; she hoped she never would. It was
more than an hour in the carriage to Nizan,
where she got into the little local train that
stopped, heaven knows how long, at every station.
And from Saint Clair, where she got out,
to Argelouse, she had to drive ten miles in a
trap, for the road was such that no car could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
driven along it at night. Fate could rise up at
any one of these stages and set her free. Thérèse
indulged herself with the fancy that had come
over her the day before the Judge had given his
decision, supposing the charge against her had
been confirmed: the possibility of an earthquake.
She took off her hat, leaned her pale cheeks and
little throbbing head against the pungent leather,
and let her body sway to the jolting of the carriage.
Until that evening she had been living
on her nerves: now that she was safe she began
to realise the extent of her exhaustion. Her
hollow cheeks, gaunt cheek-bones, sunken lips,
and low broad forehead, were surely the features
of one <span class="lock">convicted,—although</span> her fellow-men had
not pronounced her <span class="lock">guilty,—convicted</span> and condemned
to eternal solitude. That charm of hers,
which every one used to say was irresistible,—
was it not the conscious charm of those who must
be always on the watch to conceal their secret
torment, the stabbing agony of the wound within
them? In the darkness of that jolting carriage,
on that highway through the dark pine-forest,
sat a young woman, now without her mask, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
face, as she passed her hand wearily across her
forehead, was the face of one burning at the
stake. What would be the first words of Bernard
whose perjury had saved her? He would probably
not ask any questions that <span class="lock">evening,—but</span>
to-morrow? Thérèse shut her eyes, opened
them again, and, like horses when they drop into
a walk uphill, tried to realise the terrible ascent
that lay before her. Well, well, she would not
look ahead; it would perhaps be easier than she
thought; she would not look ahead at <span class="lock">all,—just</span>
sleep.... But she is no longer in the carriage
... who is that behind the green-baize
table? ... the examining Judge ... what,
again? But surely he knows that it is all over.
No, he shakes his head: the case cannot be
dropped, a new fact has come to light. A new
fact? Thérèse turns away so that her enemy
shall not see her confusion. “Cast your mind
back, Madame: In the inner pocket of that old
<span class="lock">cloak,—the</span> one you used only in October for
pigeon-shooting, was there nothing forgotten or
concealed?” She cannot speak, the words stick
in her throat. Without taking his eyes off his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
victim, the Judge lays upon the table a tiny
packet sealed with red wax. Thérèse knows by
heart the formula written on the label, which he
proceeds to read out with terrible distinctness.</p>


<ul><li>Chloroform: 10 grammes.</li>
<li>Aconitine: 2 grammes.</li>
<li>Digitaline: 20 centigrammes.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the Judge bursts out laughing....</p>

<p>The brake rasped against the wheel, and
Thérèse awoke. Her heaving lungs were full of
<span class="lock">mist,—they</span> must be driving down to the “White
Brook.” So, in her girlhood, she used to dream
that, by some mistake, she had had to take her
junior certificate examination over again; and
when she awoke this evening she felt as relieved
as she used to do in those far-off days: just a
touch of anxiety because the decision was not
yet official, though she realised, of course, that
her lawyer had to be notified first.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She was free: what more could she want?
It would be perfectly simple to put herself right
with Bernard. She would make a clean breast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of the whole thing, omitting nothing. She
would have to tell the whole story, without concealment,
and tell it that very evening. This
resolution made her feel positively cheerful.
Before she got to Argelouse, she would have
time to ‘prepare her confession,’ as her pious little
friend Anne de la Trave used to say every Saturday
of their happy holidays together. Indeed,
her innocent little sister Anne played no
mean part in this tragedy. These simple creatures
do not know in what strange happenings
they are involved by day and night, and what
poisoned growths spring up under their childish
footsteps.</p>

<p>The girl was quite right when she had said,
as she so often did to Thérèse, then a sceptical,
and mocking schoolgirl: “You can’t think how relieved
you feel when you have confessed and
been <span class="lock">forgiven,—when</span> you can begin all over
again with a clean slate.” Indeed, the moment
Thérèse had made up her mind to tell the whole
story she did feel a sort of delicious relief. She
would tell Bernard everything: she would
say....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Yes, but what should she say? How should
she begin? Could any words express that confused
succession of desires, resolves, and impulses?</p>

<p>“How do people behave,” she thought, “when
they acknowledge their crimes? I don’t acknowledge
mine: I didn’t want to commit it. I don’t
know what I did want. I never knew the meaning
of that dreadful force within me, and yet
outside me: and I was myself horrified at all the
destruction it left behind.”</p>

<p>A smoky oil lamp lit up the plaster walls of
the Nizan station and a carriage outside it: and
all about them gathered the encompassing darkness.
A train standing in the station whistled
and hooted dismally. Gardère took Thérèse’s
bag and again stared at her greedily. His wife
must have told him to watch carefully how she
was looking and behaving. For the benefit of
Monsieur Larroque’s coachman Thérèse instinctively
assumed that smile that made people say:
“Never mind whether she is pretty or plain, you
cannot resist her charm.” She asked him to take
her ticket, because she did not like to cross the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
waiting-room, where two farmers’ wives were
sitting with baskets on their knees swaying to
the rhythm of their knitting-needles.</p>

<p>When he brought back the ticket she told him
to keep the change. He touched his cap, and
then, gathering up the reins, he turned to have
a last, long look at his master’s daughter.</p>

<p>The train was not yet made up. In the old
days, at the beginning of the long vacation, or
on the way back to school, Thérèse Larroque
and Anne de la Trave enjoyed this stop at Nizan
station. They used to eat ham and eggs at the
local inn and walk with their arms round each
other’s waists down that road that looked so dark
this evening: but in those vanished years
Thérèse always saw it white under the moonlight.
And how they used to laugh at their
elongated shadows as they melted into each
other! They talked, of course, about their mistresses
and their school-friends, one standing up
for her convent and the other for her school.
“Anne!” Thérèse uttered the name aloud in the
darkness. She must begin by telling Bernard
about Anne. Her Bernard was one of the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
precise of men: he classified all emotions, kept
them rigidly apart, and ignored the complicated
network of sensations that unites them. How
could he follow her into those shadowy places
where she had lived and suffered? Yet she
must try to make him: the only thing to do, when
she went into the room later on, would be to sit
on the edge of the bed and take him, step by
step, through the whole story until he should
stop her and say: “Now I understand; get up; I
forgive you.”</p>

<p>She felt her way through the station-master’s
garden where she could smell the chrysanthemums
without seeing them. The first class compartment
was empty, and in any case the lamp
was much too dim to reveal her face. She could
not read: but Thérèse must have found any novel
insipid in comparison with the terrible story of
her life. She might die of shame, despair, remorse,
or <span class="lock">exhaustion,—but</span> of boredom, never.</p>

<p>She sat back in her corner and closed her eyes.
It was incredible that a woman of her intelligence
should not be able to make the tragedy
intelligible. When her confession was over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Bernard would of course raise her to her feet
and say: “Go in peace, Thérèse: be of good comfort:
deeds that are over and done shall never
part us now, we will wait for death together in
this house at Argelouse. I am thirsty: go down
into the kitchen and make me a glass of orangeade:
I shall drink it at a draught; no matter
what it looks like, nor even if it tastes like my
morning chocolate of those days! Do you remember
how sick I used to be, darling; and how
kindly you held my head, as you stared at that
dreadful greenish liquid? You were never
frightened when I fainted. And yet how pale
you were that night when I noticed that my legs
had gone dead and stiff! I was shivering, do you
remember? And that old fool Doctor Pédemay
who was so astonished because my temperature
was so low and my pulse so feverish....”</p>

<p>“No,” Thérèse thought to herself, “he won’t
have understood. I shall have to begin at the
very beginning.”</p>

<p>But where is the beginning of our acts? The
thread of our fate, when we try to lay it bare, is
like one of those plants that cannot be torn up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
with all its roots. Should Thérèse go back to
her childhood? But childhood itself is an end
and a fulfilment.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thérèse’s <span class="lock">childhood;—snow</span> at the source of
a stream now utterly defiled. At school she
appeared to live aloof from those petty tragedies
that tormented her companions. The mistresses
often held up Thérèse Larroque as an example
to the rest. “Thérèse,” one of them said, “is
an unusually high moral type: she knows it: and
her pride in that fact is quite enough to keep her
straight without any fear of punishment.”</p>

<p>“But was I happy?” Thérèse asked herself.
“And was I sincere? All my life before my
marriage has, as I look back on it, this air of
innocence, in contrast, no doubt, to the ineffaceable
contamination of my marriage. My life at
school, before I became a wife and a mother,
seems a paradise, though I did not realise it
then. How could I know that in those years
before my life began I was living my real life?
Pure I was: an angel if you like: but a very
passionate angel! Whatever my mistresses may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
have said, I knew what suffering was and I made
others feel it. I enjoyed the pain I gave and
the pain that my friends inflicted: my suffering
was a pure emotion, untainted by remorse: and
indeed, there was pain and joy in most simple
pleasures.”</p>

<p>But Thérèse was satisfied if she could feel
herself worthy of Anne when she met her once
more in the summer heats, under the oak trees
of Argelouse. She must be able to say to this
little offspring of the Convent: “I can be as
pure as you are without all those wreaths and
ribbons.” Besides, Anne de la Trave’s purity
was mainly ignorance. The ladies of the Sacré-Cœur
drew many veils between their little
charges and the world. Thérèse despised them
for confusing virtue and ignorance. “You don’t
know anything about life, darling,” she used
often to say, in those far-off summers at Argelouse.
Those lovely summers; Thérèse, as
she sat in the little train, that had at last begun
to move, realised that she must go back to them
if she was to get a clear view of what had happened.
It is incredible, but true, that in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
pure dawns of our lives the most dreadful storms
are already threatening in the distance. Those
azure mornings are an evil omen for the weather
of the afternoon and evening. They portend
wrecked flower-beds, broken branches, and
muddy ruin everywhere. Thérèse did not reflect,
or come to a decision at any period of her
life; there were no sharp turnings; she went
down an imperceptible slope, gradually at first,
and then faster. The lost woman of this evening
was identical with the radiant creature of those
summers at Argelouse, where she was now returning
in secret and under cover of the night.</p>

<p>How wearisome it all was! Where was the
use in trying to uncover the hidden springs of
acts accomplished? She could see nothing
through the carriage window except the reflection
of her pale expressionless face.</p>

<p>There came a sudden break in the monotonous
rhythm of the little train: the engine gave a
prolonged whistle and cautiously drew in to a
station. An arm held up a swaying lantern:
there followed shouted utterances in the local
dialect, and squeals from sundry pigs that were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
being taken off the train: Uzeste already. One
more station and then Saint Clair: thence she
must drive the rest of the way to Argelouse.
Thérèse had very little time left to prepare her
defence.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>
<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Argelouse</span> is literally one of the ends of the
<span class="lock">earth,—one</span> of those places beyond which you
cannot go; in those parts they call them
“<i lang="fr">Quartiers</i>.” A few farms, with no church or
cemetery, scattered round a field of rye, over
five miles from the market-town of Saint Clair,
with which it is connected by a single road in
very bad repair. This road, such as it is, fades
away beyond Argelouse into sandy tracks: and
thence, until the sea, there is nothing but fifty
miles of marshes, lagoons, young pines, and
sandy heath; and by the end of winter the very
sheep look as grey as that bleak landscape.</p>

<p>The best families in Saint Clair come from
these lost lands. Towards the middle of the
last century, when the sale of resin and timber
began to swell their scanty profits from flocks
and herds, the grandparents of those living
to-day moved to Saint Clair, and their ancestral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
homes at Argelouse were used as farm buildings.
The carved beams of the gables, and here and
there a marble mantelpiece, bore witness to their
ancient dignity. Every year they came nearer to
collapse, and one of the roofs had sagged lower
and lower until its eaves nearly touched the
ground. Two of these ancient habitations, however,
still housed their proprietors. The Larroque
and the Desqueyroux families left their
homes at Argelouse just as they had received
them from their predecessors. Jerôme Larroque,
Mayor and County Councillor of B.,
whose principal residence was just outside that
small provincial town, would never allow any
alterations at the estate at Argelouse, which had
come to him through his wife (who had died in
child-bed while Thérèse was still a baby), and
where he thought it quite natural that his young
daughter should like to spend her holidays. She
used to go there at the beginning of July, under
the tutelage of an elder sister of her father’s, one
Aunt Clara, a deaf old maid, who also liked the
lonely place because, as she used to say, she did
not have to be constantly watching people’s lips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
to make out what they were saying, and because
she knew that there was nothing to listen to
except the wind in the pines. Monsieur Larroque
was pleased, because Argelouse relieved
him of his daughter’s company and brought her
into contact with Bernard Desqueyroux whom
she was one day to marry, in accordance with the
wishes of both families, though the understanding
was not as yet official.</p>

<p>Bernard Desqueyroux had inherited from his
father a house at Argelouse, next to that belonging
to the Larroques: he was never seen
there until the shooting season began, and he
did not sleep there until the month of October,
when he went pigeon-shooting in the neighbourhood.
In the winter this sedate young gentleman
studied law in Paris; and in the summer he
did not spend much time with his family. He
could not endure Victor de la Trave, his mother’s
second husband, who had not had a penny when
she married him, and whose extravagance was
the scandal of Saint Clair; and his half-sister
Anne seemed too young to deserve any attention
from him. Nor did he think much more about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Thérèse. Every one regarded their marriage as
inevitable because it seemed such a pity not to
combine the two estates, and he very sensibly
shared the common opinion on this point. But
he left nothing to chance, and took a pride in
the management of his life. “If a man is unhappy
he has only himself to blame,” this slightly
corpulent youth was wont to observe. Until his
marriage he divided his time equally between
work and pleasure; and although he by no means
neglected food, drink, and sport, he worked “like
a galley slave,” so his mother said. A husband,
he thought, ought to be better informed than
his wife: and Thérèse’s intelligence was already
famous. She was doubtless clever, but Bernard
knew the kind of arguments to influence a
woman: moreover, as his mother pointed out, it
was not a bad thing to “have a leg in both
camps,” and old Larroque might be useful to
him.</p>

<p>At twenty-six years of age Bernard Desqueyroux,
after a few visits to Italy, Spain, and Holland,
which he had carefully “got up” beforehand,
would marry the richest and the cleverest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
girl in the neighbourhood, though not perhaps
the prettiest: (“Never mind whether she is pretty
or plain, you can’t resist her charm!”)</p>

<p>Thérèse smiled at the caricature of Bernard
that she drew in her mind: she reflected that
he was, in point of fact, better than most of the
young men she could have married. The women
of those moorlands by the sea are much superior
to the men, who see no one but each other after
they have left school and hardly ever lose their
boorishness. Their hearts are in their country,
and in spirit they never leave it. They are never
really happy anywhere else: they would feel that
they were being utterly false to it if they gave
up their country clothes, the local dialect, and
the rustic habits of their home. Under Bernard’s
thick skin there was certainly a sort of goodness
of heart. When he was at the point of death
the tenants said there wouldn’t be another gentleman
left when he had gone. Yes, he was certainly
kind, just, and fundamentally honest. He
never talked of what he did not know; he accepted
his own limitations. In his younger days
he had not been bad-looking, this unlicked Hyppolytus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
though he was far less interested in girls
than in the hares he coursed on the moors.</p>

<p>Yet it was not Bernard that Thérèse, with
half-closed eyes and leaning her head against
the carriage windows, pictured to herself bicycling
along the road from Saint Clair to Argelouse,
about nine o’clock, before the heat of the
day had reached its height; not her cold-blooded
suitor, but his little sister Anne, her face all
afire in the <span class="lock">sunshine;—the</span> grasshoppers were
already calling from pine to pine, and the murmurous
hum of the moorland, like the roar of
a furnace, began to rise up to the sky; and
myriads of flies hovered above the tall heather.</p>

<p>“You’d better put your cloak on to come into
the drawing-room,” she used to say, “it’s like an
ice-house”: and Aunt Clara added: “I’ll give you
something to drink, dear, when you aren’t quite
so hot.” Anne shouted futile words of greeting
to the deaf old lady: and Thérèse said: “Don’t
make yourself hoarse, darling, she understands
everything from the way you move your lips.”
But Anne insisted on articulating every word, distorting
her young lips in the process, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
Aunt made all sorts of meaningless replies, until
the friends had to run away so as to be able to
laugh unobserved.</p>

<p>In the far corner of the darkened carriage
Thérèse looked back upon those innocent <span class="lock">days,—innocent,</span>
but gladdened by a fleeting happiness,
half understood: and she could not know
that this transient gleam was all the happiness
ever to be hers. Nothing warned her that her
fate was laid in a darkened drawing-room, encompassed
by the pitiless summer, on a red-plush
sofa by the side of Anne, who sat poring
over a photograph album on her knees. Why
was she so happy? She and Anne had hardly a
single taste in common. Anne hated reading,
and did nothing but sew, chatter, and giggle.
She had not an idea in her head, while Thérèse
devoured with equal voracity the novels of Paul
de Kock, the <cite>Causeries du Lundi</cite>, the <cite>History
of the Consulate</cite>, indeed all that miscellaneous
literature that lies about in cupboards in a house
in the country. Sometimes Anne got up to see
whether the heat had passed: but as the light
burst through the half-open shutters, like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
splash of molten metal, it seemed to burn the
matting on the floor and they had to shut everything
up once more and crouch indoors. Even
at sunset, when only the feet of the pines
glowed in the level rays, and a last persistent
grasshopper could still be heard deep down
among the herbage, the heat still hovered stagnant
under the oak trees. The two friends lay
stretched upon the grass at the edge of the field,
as they might have sat down on the shore of a
lake. Stormy clouds called up fleeting pictures
as they passed; but before Thérèse could make
out the winged lady that Anne saw in the sky,
it had changed, she said, into some strange
elongated beast.</p>

<p>In September they could go out after the
midday meal and explore that land of thirst:
there was not a drop of water to be seen at
Argelouse. They had to walk far into the sandy
country before they reached the sources of the
little river called La Hure, where they bubble
up among the alder trees in a low-lying meadow.
The girls’ bare feet were benumbed by the icy
water, but they soon grew burning hot again, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
they were even dry. Like the darkened
drawing-room at home, one of the huts used in
October by the pigeon-shooters, gave them shelter.
They had nothing to say, not one word:
they sat in virgin contemplation while time fled
by, and no more thought of moving than a sportsman
who signals for silence when the birds are
coming over. They felt as though the slightest
gesture would have put to flight their chaste
ingenuous happiness. Anne was the first to break
the <span class="lock">spell,—it</span> was growing dark and she wanted
to go out shooting larks: Thérèse, though she
detested the sport, followed her, for she could
not bear to lose a minute of her company. Anne
went into the entrance hall and took down her
.24 which had no recoil. Her friend watched
her standing in the field of rye apparently aiming
at the sun. Thérèse stopped her ears: a sudden
wild cry broke the blue stillness, and the
huntress picked up the wounded bird, squeezed
it carefully, and, as she was actually brushing
the warm feathers against her lips, choked it.</p>

<p>“You will come to-morrow, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I mustn’t come every day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Anne did not want to see her every day: this
was perfectly sensible and Thérèse could say
nothing; indeed, it would not have occurred to
her to object. Anne said she would rather not
come back. No, there was nothing to prevent
her, but why should they see each other every
day? They would end, she said, by hating the
sight of each other. “You’re quite right,”
Thérèse replied, “don’t make an obligation of
it. Come back when you feel like <span class="lock">it,—when</span> you
have nothing better to do,” and the girl jumped
on her bicycle, and disappeared down the darkening
road, ringing her bell.</p>

<p>Thérèse walked back towards the house. The
tenants greeted her from a distance, though the
children stared at her and said nothing. It was
that hour of the evening when the sheep stand
scattered under the oak trees, and then rush together
into a huddled mass when they hear the
shepherd’s cry. Her Aunt was looking out for
her on the doorstep, and, as deaf people will,
talked incessantly, so as to prevent Thérèse saying
anything to her. What was this despair in
her heart? She did not want to read; she did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
not want to do anything, and wandered out of
doors once more....</p>

<p>“Don’t go far away,” said the Aunt; “dinner
will soon be ready.”</p>

<p>She went back to the edge of the road, there
was not a soul in sight, as far as the eye could
reach. Some one rang the bell for her at the
kitchen door. Perhaps the lamp would have to
be lit that evening, she thought. Indeed, this
rather haggard-looking girl felt she was living in
as deep a silence as her deaf companion, who
sat motionless with her hands crossed before her
on the table-cloth.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But what would Bernard make of this vague
world, Bernard who belonged to the blind and
ruthless race of men who know their own minds?
As soon as she began, Thérèse thought, he would
break in with: “Well, why did you marry me,
then? I wasn’t running after you.” It was
certainly true that he had shown no signs of
impatience. Thérèse remembered that Bernard’s
mother, Madame Victor de la Trave, used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
unburden herself to the casual visitor somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p>“He was quite ready to wait, but she would
have him. No, she’s not <em>quite</em> all we could wish,
I’m sorry to say: for instance, she smokes far
too <span class="lock">much,—just</span> a pose, of course. But she’s a
good girl and absolutely straightforward: and
we shall soon put a few wholesome ideas into
her head. Of course, there <em>are</em> disadvantages
about the marriage. Yes, her grandmother
Bellade,—I know all about it, but that’s all forgotten
now, isn’t it? Indeed it wasn’t really a
scandal, it was so carefully hushed up. Do you
believe in heredity? The father has no religion,
of course, but he has always set her an excellent
example: a saint in a tweed suit, so it seems.
Besides, he’s a most influential person and one
needs all the help one can get in these days.
There’s always something one has to ignore.
<span class="lock">And—strange</span> as it may <span class="lock">seem—she</span> is richer
than we are! And she worships Bernard, which
is all to the good.”</p>

<p>It was <span class="lock">true,—she</span> had worshipped Bernard: no
attitude called for less effort on her part. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
they sat in the drawing-room at Argelouse, or
lay under the oak trees, she had only to look up
at him with eyes that she knew so well how to
fill with amorous innocence. Such a victim at
his feet flattered the young gentleman but did
not surprise him. “Don’t play with her,” his
mother would say to him, “she’s eating her heart
out.”</p>

<p>“I married him because....”</p>

<p>Thérèse, with bent brows and her hand over
her eyes, tried to remember. There was the
childish joy of becoming Anne’s sister-in-law.
But it was Anne who was especially delighted
with the idea: such a bond meant little to
Thérèse. There was indeed another <span class="lock">motive,—and</span>
why should she blush for it? She was far
from indifferent to Bernard’s five thousand acres.
It was always said of her that “property was in
her blood.” At the end of interminable dinners,
when the liqueurs were put on the table, Thérèse
often stayed behind with the men, absorbed in
their talk about tenants, pit props, resin and turpentine.
Valuations and estimates roused her to
enthusiasm. The lordship over so vast a stretch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of forest had certainly dazzled her. Besides,
she thought, he, too, had fallen in love with
her pines. But perhaps Thérèse had been influenced
by a deeper feeling which she now tried
to bring to light: in this marriage she had possibly
looked less for power and possessions than
safety. Surely it was something like panic that
had hurried her into it. She had shown the practical
instincts of a housewife from her earliest
childhood, and she was impatient to occupy her
proper place in life and society, once and for all.
She wanted to be protected against she knew not
what. She had never seemed so sensible as at the
time of her betrothal: she was becoming part of
the family unit, part of the social scheme: she
was entering an Order. She was flying for
safety.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In that springtime of their betrothal they were
walking along the sandy road that leads from
Argelouse to Vilméja. The dead leaves on the
oak trees still stained the pure azure of the sky:
the ground was strewn with dead ferns, and the
acid green of the new shoots could be seen here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and there above the surface. “Mind your
cigarette,” said Bernard, “you might very well
start a fire: the soil is quite dried up.”</p>

<p>She asked him whether it was true that ferns
contained prussic acid: Bernard said he did not
know whether they contained enough to poison
any one, and enquired affectionately whether she
wanted to die: and she laughed. He expressed
the hope that she would try and be more natural:
and Thérèse remembered that she had shut her
eyes, while two great hands clasped her small
head, and a voice said in her ear: “There are
still some notions inside this that shouldn’t be
there.” And she answered: “Then you must
get rid of them, Bernard.”</p>

<p>They watched the builders adding another
room to the farm-house at Vilméja. The owners,
who came from Bordeaux, wanted to get it
ready for their youngest son who, they were told,
had got consumption and could not last long.
His sister had gone the same way. Bernard
looked on the Azévédos with the utmost contempt.
“They swear by all that’s holy,” said
he, “that they are not of Jewish extraction, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
you have only got to look at them! Consumption,
too, and Heaven knows what else.”</p>

<p>Thérèse was entirely mistress of herself.
Anne would come back from the Convent at San-Sebastian
for the wedding: she and young
Deguilhem were to take the offertory. She had
asked Thérèse to describe the bridesmaids’
dresses by return of post: in fact, she wanted
some patterns, as she said it was to everybody’s
interest that she should not choose anything that
clashed with the rest. Thérèse had never known
such peace, or what she thought was peace: it
merely meant that the reptile in her bosom was
half asleep and torpid.</p>

<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of the wedding was stifling, and it
was on that very day, in the narrow church
at Saint Clair, where the women’s whispering
drowned the wheezes of the harmonium and
their scents overpowered the incense, that
Thérèse felt that she was lost. She had been
in a trance when she entered the cage, and at
the sound of the heavy door, as it shut behind
her, the poor child awoke. Nothing was changed,
but she felt that never again would she walk
and dream alone. She was embedded in that
dreadful family, where she would smoulder like
a malignant fire creeping through the heather
and setting one pine alight and then another,
until the forest is a mass of flaming torches.
There was not one face in all that crowded
church on which she cared to rest her eyes,
except Anne’s: but the girl’s childish glee made
Thérèse draw back. Surely Anne must realise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
that they would be parted that very evening,
and not in space alone: but because of what
Thérèse must suffer, that inexpiable thing that
her body must so soon endure. Anne stayed behind
on the shore in the company of those as
yet immaculate: Thérèse was to go down among
the herd whom use has soiled. As she bent down
in the sacristy to kiss the little laughing lips, she
became suddenly aware of the insignificance of
this creature who had been, for her, the centre
of a world of fantastic joys and sorrows: in those
few seconds, she measured the infinite disparity
between the dark forces in her heart and this
pretty powdered face.</p>

<p>Long afterwards, at Saint Clair and at B.,
every one who spoke of those magnificent celebrations
(more than a hundred tenants and
servants had sat down to eat and drink under
the oak trees) always alluded to the fact that
the bride (“Never mind whether she is pretty
or plain, you can’t resist her charm!”) looked
ugly, almost repulsive. “She wasn’t like herself,”
they would say: “she seemed another person.”
To them she merely looked different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
from usual; and they put it down to the white
wedding-dress and the heat. They did not know
that it was her real face.</p>

<p>Late in the day of that half-rustic wedding,
groups of country people, the girls conspicuous
in their gay dresses, made the car of the newly
married pair slow down while they cheered
them; the road was strewn with acacia blossoms,
and they passed a number of country carts pursuing
a somewhat zigzag course, driven by certain
cheerful fellows who had clearly had a glass or
two of wine. As she recalled the night that followed,
Thérèse murmured: “It was horrible”:
then, correcting herself; “No, not so horrible
as all that.”</p>

<p>After all, she did not suffer much while they
were travelling in the Italian lakes. She was
absorbed in the game of keeping her secret. A
fiancé is easily deceived, but a husband—!
Any one can tell lies: but physical lying is a
different art. It is not given to every one to
imitate desire, delight, and the happy lassitude
of love. Thérèse discovered how to bend her
body to these impersonations, and she took a bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
pleasure in so doing. In that unknown world
of sensations, which a man was now compelling
her to explore, she could imagine that she, too,
might have found a possible happiness. What
would it have been like? When we stand before
a landscape shrouded in rain and try to picture
what it would have looked like in sunshine, so
Thérèse became acquainted with desire.</p>

<p>Her young husband Bernard, with his vacant
eyes, always worried because the numbers on
the pictures did not correspond with those given
in Baedeker, content if he had seen the sights in
the shortest possible <span class="lock">time,—what</span> an easy dupe
he was! He was pent up in his pleasures, like
those little pigs that are so charming to watch
through the palings of their sty, snuffling with
satisfaction, in their trough (“I was the trough”:
thought Thérèse). He had their hurried, fussy,
serious look: he was methodical. “Do you really
think we should do that?” ventured Thérèse
sometimes, in her stupefaction. He laughed and
reassured her: Where had he learnt to classify
everything affecting the <span class="lock">body,—to</span> distinguish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the honest man’s caresses from those of the
sadist? He was never in a moment’s doubt.
One evening in Paris, where they stopped on
their return journey, Bernard ostentatiously left
a music-hall at which the performance shocked
him: “And to think that foreigners see that!
Disgraceful! And that is what they judge
by....”</p>

<p>Thérèse marvelled that this modest fellow was
the same man whose patient ingenuities of the
darkness she would, in less than an hour, have
to endure.</p>

<p>“Poor <span class="lock">Bernard—no</span> worse than another. But
desire transforms the being that lays hands on
us into a monster quite unlike himself. Nothing
divides us from our accomplice but his frenzy:
I have always seen Bernard wallowing in his
pleasure: and I,—I lay like one dead, as if this
epileptic madman might have risked strangling
me if I had moved an inch. More often than
not, at the supreme moment, he suddenly
realised he was alone; and the dismal ecstasy
came abruptly to an end. Bernard retraced his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
steps and found me lying as if I had been thrown
up on a sea shore, cold and with clenched teeth.”</p>

<p>One letter from Anne and one only: the child
did not care about writing;—but, it so happened
that there was not a line that Thérèse did not
read with pleasure. A letter is far less an expression
of our real sentiments than of those we ought
to feel if our letter is to be welcome. Anne
complained that she could not go in the direction
of Vilméja since young Azévédo had come; she
had seen his wheeled chair among the ferns; consumptives
made her shudder.</p>

<p>Thérèse read the letter over and over again
and did not expect any others: so she was much
surprised when they got their letters (the day
after the interrupted evening at the music-hall)
to recognise Anne de la Trave’s writing on three
envelopes. Various “Postes Restantes” had sent
this bundle of letters on to Paris, for they had
not stopped at several places on their programme:
“they were in a hurry,” Bernard said, “to get
back to their nest”; but the real reason was that
they could not endure each other any longer.
He was dying of boredom away from his guns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
his dogs, and the inn, where the bitters and
pomegranate syrup tasted better than anywhere
else; and he was sick of this cold mocking woman
who never seemed to be enjoying herself and
could not talk about anything interesting!...
Thérèse wanted to get back to Saint Clair, like
a convict, who has grown tired of his temporary
cell, becomes curious about the island in which
the remainder of his life is to be spent. Thérèse
had carefully deciphered the date stamped on
each of the three envelopes; and she was just
opening the first when Bernard uttered an exclamation,
shouted several words which she did not
catch, for the window was open, and as their
hotel was at a street corner the motor-buses
changed gears immediately outside. He had
stopped shaving to read a letter from his mother.
Thérèse could still see his “cellular” vest and
his muscular bare arms: the pale skin, and then
the sudden coarse crimson of the neck and face.
The July morning was already heavy with sulphurous
heat: the smoky sunshine made the house
fronts opposite, beyond the balcony, look grimier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
still. He had come up to Thérèse, and shouted:
“This is too much. Your little friend Anne is
going it! Who’d have said that my young sister....”
And as Thérèse looked at him questioningly:</p>

<p>“She’s fallen in love with the Azévédo boy:
can you believe it? Yes, really; that consumptive
fellow for whom they were enlarging Vilméja....
She says she’ll wait until she’s of
age.... Mother says she is completely mad.
I only hope the Deguilhems don’t know anything
about it. Young Deguilhem would be quite
capable of giving up the marriage altogether.
Have you got letters from her? Now we shall
know all about it then: aren’t you going to open
them?”</p>

<p>“I want to read them in order. Besides, I
couldn’t show them to you.”</p>

<p>This was just like her: she complicated everything.
However, the essential point was that
she should bring the girl to her senses again.</p>

<p>“My parents are relying on you. She’ll do
anything you tell her.... Oh yes, she will....
You can save the situation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>While she was dressing, he would go out to
send a telegram and book two seats on the Southern
Express: and she might begin to pack the
trunks.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you reading the child’s letters?
What are you waiting for?”</p>

<p>“I’m waiting till you have gone.”</p>

<p>Long after he had shut the door Thérèse had
remained lying on the sofa smoking cigarettes,
and staring at the great letters of blackened gilt,
fixed to the balcony opposite: then she had torn
open the first envelope. No: it could not be
that sweet little fool, that light-headed little
Convent girl who had conceived these words of
flame. It could not be that chilly little <span class="lock">heart,—for</span>
such it was, and Thérèse ought to know!—which
had poured forth that Song of Songs, that
long ecstatic lamentation of a woman possessed,
of a body almost stricken down with joy, from
the first encounter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>... When I met him, I could not believe it
was he: he was chasing one of the dogs and shouting.
How could I have imagined it was the invalid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
... but he isn’t an invalid: he is simply
taking precautions, because of his family history.
He isn’t even <span class="lock">delicate,—only</span> rather thin: and of
course he’s used to being spoilt and pampered
... you would not recognise me: I actually go
and fetch his overcoat as soon as it gets cooler.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>If Bernard had come back into the room that
minute, he would have noticed that the woman
sitting on the bed was not his wife, but some one
he did not know, a strange and nameless creature.
She threw away her cigarette, and tore
open a second envelope.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>... I don’t care how long I have to wait: I
don’t mind what they say: indeed, I don’t mind
anything since I have been in love. They are
keeping me at Saint Clair, but Argelouse is not
so far off that Jean and I cannot meet. Do you
remember the pigeon-shooters’ hut? Why, it
was you, darling, that chose beforehand the places
where I was to know such happiness.... Oh,
please don’t think we do anything we should not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
He is so considerate. You have no idea what a
boy of his kind is like. He has studied and read
a great deal, like you: but I don’t mind that in a
young man and I never think of teasing him about
it. I do not know what I would give to be as
clever as you are. Oh, my darling, I wonder
what your happiness can be like, if the mere approach
to it is so exquisite. When I sit beside him
in the hut, where you used to like to take our
lunch, and his hand lies still on my <span class="lock">heart,—and</span>
I put my hand on his (it is what he calls: ‘the last
caress allowed’), I feel happiness within me like
something that I could touch. I tell myself that
there is yet another joy beyond this one; and
when Jean goes away, quite pale, the memory of
our caresses, the thought of the next day and all
that it will bring, makes me deaf to the complaints
and prayers and insults of those poor
people who do not know ... have never
known: Darling, forgive me: I talk to you about
this happiness as if you did not know it either: and
yet I am only a novice beside you: and also I am
sure that you will be on our side against these
cruel people.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Thérèse opened the third envelope: only a
brief scrawl.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>Do come, darling: they have separated us,
and I am not allowed out of sight. They believe
that you will be on their side. I have said that
I will abide by your judgement. I will explain
everything: he is not ill.... I am happy though
I suffer. I am happy to suffer because of him and
his suffering is a joy to me because it is the proof
of his love for me....</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>Thérèse read no further. As she slipped the
sheet into the envelope, she saw a photograph
inside it that she had not noticed; she stood near
the window and examined the face: it was that
of a youth whose head, owing to his thick hair,
seemed too large for him. Thérèse recognized
the place where the photograph had been taken:
an embankment on which Jean Azévédo stood up
like David (behind him was a stretch of heath
on which sheep were pasturing). His coat was
over his arm: and his shirt a little open ...
(“the last caress allowed”). Thérèse raised her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
eyes and was amazed at the reflection of her face
in the mirror. It cost her an effort to unclench
her teeth and swallow. She rubbed her temples
and forehead with eau-de-Cologne.</p>

<p>“She knows that joy ... what about me,
why shouldn’t I know it too?” The photograph
lay on the table: she caught the glitter of a pin
beside it.</p>

<p>“I did that. I actually did that.” ... In
the jolting train, now moving faster down a
gradient, Thérèse said slowly to herself: “It is
two years ago since, in that hotel bedroom, I
picked up the pin and ran it through the boy’s
photograph in the region of the <span class="lock">heart,—not</span>
violently, but coolly, as if I was doing something
quite ordinary;—and then I threw the photograph
down the lavatory; and pulled the plug.”</p>

<p>When Bernard came back he had remarked
how serious she looked, like some one who has
been thinking something over, and decided what
to do. But she ought not to smoke so much, he
said: she was poisoning herself. Thérèse said
that too much importance should not be attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
to a young girl’s fancies. She promised to bring
her to a right view of things. Bernard wanted
Thérèse to reassure <span class="lock">him,—full</span> of the joy of
feeling the return tickets in his pockets; and more
especially gratified that his family had already
asked for his wife’s help. He announced that,
cost what it might, for the last luncheon on their
trip they would go to some restaurant in the
Bois. In the taxi he talked about his plans for
the shooting season; he was in a hurry to try
the dog that Balion was breaking in for him. His
mother wrote that since the mare had been fired
she did not limp any more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There were not yet many people in the restaurant,
where the innumerable waiters made them
nervous. Thérèse still remembered the <span class="lock">smell—a</span>
blend of geraniums and vinegar. Bernard had
never tasted Hock (“Good Lord, they don’t give
it away: still, Christmas only comes once a
year!”). Bernard’s broad shoulders prevented
Thérèse seeing much of the room. Behind the
great plate-glass windows, motor-cars slid up
and stopped, more silently than in a film. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
watched what she knew to be the temporal
muscles moving behind Bernard’s ears. After
the first few glasses he got flushed: for some
weeks now this handsome cavalier from the country
had had no means of working off his daily
ration of food and drink. She did not hate him
but how she longed to be alone to think about
her pain and find exactly where it lay. She
simply wished he was somewhere else, so that
she might no longer have to force herself to eat
and smile, compose her face, and veil the fire
that must be blazing in her eyes: so that her mind
might dwell freely on her mysterious despair....
Some one has escaped from the desert
island where you thought to have her with you
till the end; she crosses the abyss that divides
you from the world and is gone;—to another
planet, ... and yet: No.... Who has ever
been able to do that? Anne was always one of
those who were content with life as it came: it
was a changeling whose sleeping head Thérèse
had watched lying on her lap, in their solitary
holidays together: she had never known the real
Anne de la Trave, the one who was now meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Jean Azévédo in the deserted shooting-hut between
Saint Clair and Argelouse.</p>

<p>“What is the matter? You aren’t eating.
You mustn’t leave anything: it would be a shame
considering the price it costs. Is it the heat?
You aren’t going to faint, I hope. Or perhaps
you’re feeling sick ... already?”</p>

<p>She smiled ... with her lips only. She said
she was thinking about Anne’s adventure (she
had to talk about Anne). And as Bernard said
he was not bothering himself any longer now
that she had the matter in hand, his wife asked
him why his parents were opposed to the marriage.
He thought she was laughing at him, and
begged her not to begin her paradoxes.</p>

<p>“In the first place, you know very well they
are Jews: Mother knew his grandfather, the one
who refused to be baptised.”</p>

<p>But Thérèse pretended that these Portuguese-Jewish
names were the oldest in Bordeaux:</p>

<p>“The Azévédos were great people when our
ancestors were miserable shepherds, shivering
with fever by their marshes.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Thérèse: don’t argue for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
pleasure of arguing: all Jews are the same ...
and besides they’re a degenerate <span class="lock">family—consumptive</span>
to the marrow, everybody knows it.”</p>

<p>She lit a cigarette with a gesture that had always
offended Bernard:</p>

<p>“Well, then, tell me what your grandfather,
and your great-grandfather died of. When you
married me did you bother to enquire what illness
carried off my mother? Don’t you suppose that
we should find enough consumptives and syphilitics
among our ancestors to poison the universe?”</p>

<p>“You go too far, Thérèse, let me tell you.
Even when you’re joking and trying to get a
rise out of me, you ought to respect the family.”</p>

<p>He positively gobbled with annoyance, trying
to be impressive and, at the same time, not to
look foolish. But she persisted:</p>

<p>“Really, our families make me laugh: they’re
too ridiculous. They’re terribly shocked when a
thing like this is publicly known, but they’re
quite indifferent to all the horrors no one talks
about.... Why, you yourself use the expression
‘secret diseases,’ don’t you? Surely the diseases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
most dangerous to the race are just precisely
those. Our families never think of them, though
they are so very clever at bundling anything unpleasant
out of sight. If it wasn’t for the servants
we should know nothing about them:
fortunately there are the servants....”</p>

<p>“I shan’t answer you. When you start off
like this, the best thing to do is to wait until
you’ve finished. With me, it doesn’t matter so
very much. But it won’t do at all at home, you
know. We don’t make jokes about the family.”</p>

<p>The family! Thérèse let her cigarette go out.
With staring eyes, she saw before her that cage
with its innumerable and living bars, a cage set
with ears and eyes, in which she would crouch
motionless, her chin on her knees, and her arms
clasping her legs, and wait for death.</p>

<p>“Come, come, Thérèse, don’t look like that:
if you could see yourself....”</p>

<p>She smiled and put on her mask again.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t serious ... how silly you are,
darling.” But when Bernard tried to come near
to her in the taxi, she evaded him and kept him
off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The last evening before they returned home,
they went to bed at nine o’clock. Thérèse took
a cachet, but she was too impatient for sleep and
it would not come. For an instant, her mind
began to sink beneath the surface when Bernard,
with unintelligible mumblings, turned over; and
she felt his great fiery body against her own.
She pushed it from her and, shrinking from that
odious warmth, she lay on the extreme edge of
the bed: but after a few minutes, he again rolled
towards her as if the flesh in him survived his
absent spirit and, even in sleep, fumbled for its
accustomed prey. She again thrust him back,
roughly this time, but he did not wake....
Oh! if she could push him away once and for all,
hurl him out of bed into the darkness!</p>

<p>Through the Paris night, the motor-horns
answered each other like the dogs and cocks at
Argelouse when the moon is up. Not a breath
of air rose from the street. Thérèse turned on
a lamp and, with her elbow on the pillow, looked
at this motionless being asleep beside <span class="lock">her—her</span>
twenty-seven-year-old husband: he had pushed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
aside the bed-clothes, and she could not hear him
breathing. His tumbled hair straggled over his
smooth young forehead. He slept, like Adam,
naked and unashamed, a deep and seemingly
eternal sleep. The woman threw the sheet over
him, got out of bed, looked for one of the letters
that she had only half-read, and brought it to
the lamp.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>If he told me to follow him, I would leave
everything and not look back. We stopped at the
edge, the furthest edge of the last caress, but
because he wanted to, not because I insisted; it is
really he who resists me, and I who long to reach
those unknown limits the mere approach to
which, he often tells me, is beyond all joys there
are: but he won’t go any further: he is proud of
being able to stop where he says others cannot
help letting themselves go.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>Thérèse opened the window, tore up the letters
into tiny pieces, bending out over the stone
abyss through which, in that hour before the
dawn, rumbled a solitary dung-cart. The scraps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of paper fluttered down, and came to rest on the
balconies of the lower storeys.</p>

<p>That odour of herbage that she could <span class="lock">smell—she</span>
wondered from what countryside it had
blown hither to this asphalt desert? She pictured
the splash of her crushed body on the
pavement, surrounded by an eddy of policemen
and loiterers.... (“You’re too imaginative to
kill yourself, Thérèse!”) In truth, she did not
want to die; there was a task before her <span class="lock">now—not</span>
of vengeance or of hatred; but that little
fool away at Saint Clair, who thought happiness
possible, must learn, like Thérèse, that happiness
does not exist. If they possess nothing else in
common, let them at least have this: boredom,
no rational occupation, nothing to look forward
to but the sordid daily <span class="lock">round,—irremediable</span>
solitude.</p>

<p>The dawn lit up the roofs; she rejoined her
motionless companion on the bed; but the moment
she lay down beside him he drew nearer.</p>

<p>She awoke, clear-headed and self-possessed.
What were these wandering desires? Her
family had asked for her help and she would do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
as they wished; then she could not go astray.
Thérèse agreed with Bernard when he said that
if Anne missed the Deguilhem marriage it would
be a disaster. The Deguilhems did not belong
to their world: the grandfather had been a
shepherd.... Yes, but they had the finest
pines in the district: and, after all, Anne was
not particularly well off: she had nothing to
expect from her father except the vines in the
marsh, near <span class="lock">Langon—which</span> were under water
one year out of two. Anne must on no account
miss the Deguilhem marriage. The smell of
chocolate in the room upset Thérèse; this slight
feeling of sickness confirmed other signs: she
was going to have a baby already. “Much better
to have it at once,” said Bernard, “and then
we won’t have to think anything more about it.”
And he eyed respectfully the woman who bore
within her the sole owner of innumerable pines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Clair</span>! They would soon be there.</p>

<p>Thérèse measured with her eye the distance
that her thought had traversed; could she get
Bernard to follow her so far? She did not dare
to hope that he would consent to move so slowly
along that tortuous road. And yet the essential
had not yet been spoken:</p>

<p>“Even when I have brought him as far as
this, I shall still have everything to tell him.”
She brooded over the enigma that was herself,
she passed in review the young married women
of her class whose virtues were so highly praised
by every one, at the time she settled down at
Saint Clair; and she reconstructed the first weeks
of her life in the cool dark house of her parents-in-law.
The shutters were always closed on the
side looking on to the Market Square; but, on
the left, through a barred window, could be
seen the garden, on fire with heliotrope, geraniums,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
and petunias. Thérèse came and went, a
confidant and an accomplice, between the La
Trave couple ambushed in the depths of a little
dark sitting-room, on the ground floor, and
Anne wandering in the garden which she was
forbidden to leave. She said to the La Traves:</p>

<p>“Try and conciliate her by giving way a little,
suggest that you should all go abroad for a time
before anything is settled: I’ll see that she obeys
you on this point: and while you are away, I’ll
do what I can.” What would she do? The La
Traves gathered that she would strike up an
acquaintance with young Azévédo: “A direct
attack is hopeless, mother.” So far as Madame
de la Trave knew, nothing had come out as yet,
thank Heaven. The postmistress, Mademoiselle
Monod, was the only person in the secret: she
had intercepted several of Anne’s letters: “but
that girl’s like a grave.... Anyhow, she
daren’t give anything away.”</p>

<p>“Let us try to give her as little pain as possible....”
Hector de la Trave used to say: but
he who used to give way to Anne’s absurdest
caprices, could only agree with his wife, saying:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
“You can’t make omelettes without breaking
eggs ...”: and again: “She’ll be grateful to us
one day.” Yes, but before that day came,
wouldn’t she collapse? And the pair sat in silence
with troubled eyes: they pictured their
child wasting away in the blazing sunshine, and
turning with loathing from all food: trampling
on the flowers that she could not see and pacing
back and forwards along the railings like a fawn
looking for a way of escape.... Madame de
la Trave shook her head: “I can’t drink her meat-juice
instead of her, can I? She stuffs herself
with fruit in the garden so as to be able to leave
her plate empty at meals.”</p>

<p>And Hector de la Trave: “She would blame
us later on for having given our consent ...
even if only for the sake of the unhappy children
that she might bring into the world....”</p>

<p>His wife was annoyed with him for seeming to
try and find excuses for the girl: “Fortunately
the Deguilhems are not back yet. We may think
ourselves lucky that they’re most anxious for the
marriage....”</p>

<p>They waited until Thérèse had left the room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
to ask each other: “But what can they have put
into her head at the Convent? She has had
nothing but good examples here; we have supervised
her reading.... Thérèse says that there
is nothing worse for turning young girls’ heads
than the love stories in the Sunday Reading
Series ... but then she’s so paradoxical....
Besides, I’m thankful to say Anne never did care
about reading: she is quite domesticated on that
point. I believe if we could only manage to get
her a change of air. Do you remember how
much good Salies did her when she had bronchitis
after the measles? We will go wherever
she likes, I can’t say more than that. Really,
I’m truly sorry for the child.” Monsieur de la
Trave sighed dubiously: “Well, but a holiday
with us.... Nothing, nothing,” he added hurriedly
in answer to his wife who, being a little
deaf, had asked him what he had said. From
the refuge of his wife’s fortune, in which he had
come so comfortably to rest, what memories of
passionate pilgrimages did the old gentleman
suddenly call to mind, what hallowed hours of
his amorous youth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Thérèse had then gone out into the garden to
Anne, whose last year’s dresses had already
grown too <a id="chg1"></a>loose for her. “Well?” cried the girl,
as soon as her friend came up. The ashes on
the garden paths, the dry harsh grass of the
lawns, the smell of the parched geraniums, and
Anne herself more wasted than any plant on
that August afternoon,—Thérèse could recall
every detail of the scene. Sometimes stormy
showers forced them to take refuge in the hot-house,
while the hailstones rattled on the glass
roof.</p>

<p>“Why do you mind going away, since you
don’t see him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see him, but I know he is living and
breathing four miles away. When the wind is
in the east, I know he hears the church bell at
the same time as I do. Would you not care
whether Bernard was at <a id="chg2"></a>Argelouse or Paris? I
don’t see Jean, but I know he’s not far off. On
Sunday, at Mass, I do not even try to turn my
head, because we can only see the altar from
where we sit, and we are shut off from the congregation
by a pillar. But as we go out....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“Wasn’t he there on Sunday?”</p>

<p>Thérèse knew it; she knew that as Anne was
being led away by her mother she had searched
in vain among the crowd for a face that was not
there.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was ill.... They stop his
letters. I’m not allowed to know anything.”</p>

<p>“Still, it’s strange he can’t find some means of
getting a word to you.”</p>

<p>“If you only would, Thérèse.... Yes, I
know your position is delicate....”</p>

<p>“Agree to go away, and then, perhaps....”</p>

<p>“I can’t go away from him.”</p>

<p>“But he’ll go away in any case, darling. He’ll
be leaving Argelouse in a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, don’t. It’s too dreadful. And
not a word from him to help me to live. I can’t
bear it much longer: every moment I can’t help
remembering the words of his that made me
happiest: but I have said them over to myself so
often, I’ve begun to be not quite sure whether
he really did say them. Why, I can still hear
his voice as he said to me, when we last met:
‘There is no one in my life but you....’ That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
is what he <span class="lock">said,—or</span> it may have <span class="lock">been:—‘You</span>
are what is dearest to me in life.’ I can’t remember
exactly.”</p>

<p>And with knitted brows she tried to recall the
echo of those consoling words whose meaning
seemed to her so overwhelming.</p>

<p>“Well, tell me what the young man is like.”</p>

<p>“You can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“Is he so unlike the others?”</p>

<p>“I should like to describe him ... but he is
so much beyond anything I could say....
After all, you might think him quite ordinary....
But I’m sure you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>She could no longer see any individual traits
in the youth whose image glowed with all the
love she bore him. “Passion,” thought Thérèse,
“would make me more clear-sighted: nothing
would escape me in the human being I wanted
for my own.”</p>

<p>“Thérèse, if I gave in about this trip, you
would see him, wouldn’t you, and tell me exactly
what he said? And you would take my letters
to him? If I go away, if I can bear to go
away....” Thérèse left the kingdom of light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
and fire and penetrated once more, like some ill-omened
wasp, into the study where the parents
waited until the heat had passed, and their
daughter’s resistance had broken down. It was
not until after many such comings and goings
that Anne finally consented to go away. And
Thérèse would no doubt never have succeeded
had it not been for the imminent return of the
Deguilhems. The girl trembled at this further
danger. Thérèse said to her more than once
that, “for a rich young man, Deguilhem wasn’t
at all bad.”</p>

<p>“But, Thérèse, I’ve hardly looked at him: he
wears glasses, he’s <span class="lock">bald,—why,</span> he’s an old man.”</p>

<p>“He’s twenty-nine.”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I said, he’s an old <span class="lock">man,—and</span>
besides, old or not....”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At dinner in the evening, the La Traves were
talking about Biarritz, and began to consider the
question of hotels. Thérèse watched Anne, a
body without movement and without soul.
“Make an effort”; Madame de la Trave kept
on saying: “you can if you try.” Anne raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the spoon to her lips with a mechanical gesture.
There was no light in her eyes. Nothing and
nobody had any existence for her except the one
who was not there. Sometimes a smile wandered
over her lips at the recollection of a word or
caress of Jean Azévédo at the time when they
used to sit in that hut with its walls of heather,
and those strong fingers, stronger than he knew,
tore her blouse a little....</p>

<p>Thérèse looked at Bernard’s head and shoulders
bent over his plate: as he was sitting with
his back to the light she could not see his face;
but she heard him slowly masticating, ruminating
that sacred substance, his food. She left the
table. Her mother-in-law said: “She would
sooner we did not take any notice of her: I should
like to make a fuss of her, but she does not care
to be looked after. These feelings of sickness
are the least she can expect in her condition. But
she may say what she likes; she does smoke too
much.” And the good lady recalled her own
memories of pregnancy. “I remember when I
was expecting you, I had to sniff an india-rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
ball: it was the only thing that would settle my
stomach.”</p>

<p>“Thérèse, where are you?”</p>

<p>“Here, on the seat.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I can see your cigarette.”</p>

<p>Anne sat down, leaned her head against a
motionless shoulder, looked up at the sky, and
said: “He sees these very stars, he hears the
Angelus....”</p>

<p>And she asked Thérèse to kiss her. But
Thérèse did not bend down to that confiding
little face. She merely asked:</p>

<p>“Are you unhappy?”</p>

<p>“Not this evening: I have realised that by
some means or another I shall come to him
again. The main thing is that he should know
it; and he will know it through you: I have
made up my mind to go away. But when I
return, no walls shall keep me back: sooner or
later, I shall lay my head upon his heart: I am
as sure of that as I am that I’m alive. No,
Thérèse, no: you, at least, must not talk morality
to me, or about the family....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not thinking of the family, darling, but
of him: you can’t drop into a man’s life just like
that: he has his family, too, his own interests,
his work, a love-affair perhaps....”</p>

<p>“No, he once said to me: ‘There is only you
in my life ...’ and another time: ‘Our love
is the only thing I care for now....’”</p>

<p>“Yes, now....”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose he was only thinking of
the present moment, do you?”</p>

<p>Thérèse had no longer any need to ask her if
she was unhappy. She could feel her misery in
the darkness: but she did not pity her. Why
should she? How delightful it must be to repeat
a name, a Christian name, that stands for a
certain being to whom one’s heart is bound so
closely! The mere thought that he is living,
breathing, and sleeping at night with his head
upon his folded arm; that he wakes at dawn,
and his young body moves through the mists of
morning....</p>

<p>“Why, you’re crying, Thérèse: is it because of
me? You must be fond of me.”</p>

<p>The child had knelt down and laid her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
against Thérèse’s side, when she suddenly started
back:</p>

<p>“I felt something moving against my forehead....”</p>

<p>“Yes, it began to move a few days ago.”</p>

<p>“The little one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s alive already.”</p>

<p>They had come back to the house, with their
arms round each other as they used to do along
the road to Nizan, or Argelouse. Thérèse remembered
that she had been afraid of that fluttering
burden. How many passions were to
make their way into that as yet unformed flesh.
She saw herself as she had sat that evening in
her bedroom, by the open window (Bernard
had shouted up from the garden: “Don’t light
the lamp because of the mosquitoes”). She
counted the months before the birth, she would
have liked to have known a God who might
answer her prayer that this unknown creature,
still intermingled with her body, might never
see the light.</p>

<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was strange that Thérèse only remembered
the days that followed the departure of Anne
and of the La Traves as of a period of torpor.
At Argelouse, where it had been agreed that she
should find the best means of working on
Azévédo and making him give the girl up, she
thought of nothing but rest and sleep. Bernard
had agreed not to live in his own house, but in
Thérèse’s, which was much more comfortable
and where Aunt Clara spared them all the worries
of housekeeping. What did other people
matter to Thérèse? Let them arrange their own
affairs. She refused to emerge from her stupor
until the child was born. Bernard annoyed her
every morning by reminding her of her promise
to see Jean Azévédo. But Thérèse snubbed him:
she began to be less able to endure his company.
It may be that her pregnancy, as Bernard believed,
had something to do with her ill-humour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
He himself was just undergoing the first attacks
of an obsession so common in the men of his
race, though it rarely shows itself before the
thirtieth year: the fear of death, that seemed at
first so astonishing in a young man of his solid
physique. But what could one say when he protested:
“You don’t know what I feel like.” Men
like him, mighty eaters, sprung from a lazy and
overfed race, have only the appearance of
strength. A pine tree planted in a manured field
shoots up quickly: but very soon the heart of
the tree grows rotten, and it must be cut down
in the height of its strength. “It’s nerves”:
people would say to Bernard: but he himself felt
the flaw in the metal. Besides, though it was
almost inconceivable, he hardly ate, he was no
longer hungry. “Why don’t you see a doctor?”
He shrugged his shoulders with affected indifference:
as a matter of fact, uncertainty seemed to
him less terrible than a possible verdict of death.
In the night Thérèse was sometimes awakened
with a start by his gasps for breath: Bernard’s
hand sought hers and he laid it against his left
chest so that she could feel the intermittent beating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of his heart. She lit the candle, got up, and
poured some valerian into a glass of water. How
lucky it was, she thought, that this mixture was
harmless! Why wasn’t it mortal? Nothing
really soothes, and brings sleep, unless it does so
for all eternity. Why was this querulous creature
so frightened of what would bring him
relief once and for all? He went to sleep before
she did. How could she lie and wait for sleep beside
this great <a id="chg4"></a>carcass whose snorings sometimes
turned to choking agony? Thank God, he no
longer came near <span class="lock">her,—he</span> thought love-making
the most dangerous of all activities for his heart.
The cocks of dawn brought the farms to life.
The Angelus of Saint Clair tinkled in the east
wind; Thérèse’s eyes at last closed. Then the
man’s body began to stir once more: he dressed
himself quickly, like a peasant (he scarcely put
his head into cold water). He crept like a dog
down to the kitchen, sniffing after the scraps in
the larder: breakfasted on the remains of a
bird, or a wedge of cold spiced meat, or even on
a bunch of grapes and a crust of bread rubbed
with garlic: his only decent meal in the day. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
threw some bits to Flambeau and Diane whose
jaws were chattering. The mist had the smell
of Autumn. It was the hour when Bernard was
no longer in pain, when he felt his all-powerful
youth once more within him. The pigeons
would soon be coming over: it was time to see
about the decoy-birds, and take their eyes out.
At eleven o’clock he found Thérèse still in bed.</p>

<p>“Well: and the Azévédo boy? You know
my mother is waiting for news at Biarritz, at
the Poste Restante.”</p>

<p>“And your heart?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk about my heart. You’ve only got
to start talking about it and I begin to feel it
again. That shows it’s nervous: don’t you think
so?”</p>

<p>She never gave him the answer he wanted.</p>

<p>“You never know: you alone can say what you
feel like. There’s no reason because your
father died of angina pectoris ... especially at
your age.... Evidently the heart is the weak
point of the Desqueyroux family. How absurd
you are, Bernard, with your fear of death!
Don’t you ever feel as I do, profoundly convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of your own uselessness? No? Don’t
you think that the life of people like us is already
terribly like death?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders: her paradoxes
were really too tiresome. It is easy enough to
be witty, he said: you have only to say exactly
the opposite to what is sensible. But she was
wrong to waste her efforts on him: she had better
save herself for her interview with young
Azévédo. “You know he is going to leave
Vilméja about the middle of October?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At Villandraut, the station before Saint Clair,
Thérèse thought: “How shall I persuade
Bernard that I was never in love with that young
man? He will certainly believe I adored him.
Like every one who knows nothing about love,
he imagines that a crime like mine could only
be a crime of passion.”</p>

<p>Bernard would have to understand that at
that time she was far from hating him, although
she often found him a nuisance: but she did not
suppose that any other man could help her.
Bernard, all things considered, was not so bad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
She hated the descriptions in novels of marvellous
creatures that no one ever meets in real life.
The only outstanding personality she thought she
had ever known was her father. She tried to
persuade herself that this obstinate, suspicious
old radical was something of a figure. He was
a man of many interests: manufacturer, landed
proprietor (besides a saw-mill at B——, he
handled his own resin and that of his numerous
relatives in a factory at Saint Clair)—but, above
all, a politician, whose brusque manner had done
him harm but made him much respected at the
Prefecture. And how he did despise women!
He even despised Thérèse, when every one was
praising her intelligence. And now since the
tragedy: “They’re all hysterics when they aren’t
fools,” he used to say to his lawyer. And this
old anticlerical had his ideas of decency. Though
he would often hum a refrain from Béranger,
he could not endure certain subjects being mentioned
in his <span class="lock">presence,—indeed,</span> he blushed like
a schoolboy. Bernard had heard from Monsieur
de la Trave that Monsieur Larroque had been a
virgin when he married: “and since he has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
a widower I have always understood there was
never any talk of a mistress. He’s a character,
your father!”</p>

<p>Yes, he was a character. But if Thérèse’s view
of him, at a distance, was rather highly coloured,
as soon as he was with her, she took the measure
of his mean soul. He seldom came to Saint
Clair, but more often to Argelouse, as he did
not like meeting the La Traves. In their presence,
although politics were forbidden, the old
stupid quarrel began the moment the soup was
brought in and soon became embittered.
Thérèse would have been ashamed to take part
in it: she took a pride in never opening her
mouth, except when they touched on the religious
question. Then she rushed to Monsieur
Larroque’s assistance. Everybody shouted, so
much so that Aunt Clara caught a few scattered
phrases, joined the mêlée and, in the raucous
tones of the deaf, let loose all the fury of the
hardened radical, “who knows all about what
goes on in convents”; she was, Thérèse thought,
really more of a believer than any of the La
Traves, but she was in open war against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Almighty who had allowed her to be deaf and
ugly, and to die without ever having known love
nor passion. Since one day when Madame de la
Trave had left the table, by common consent
they avoided metaphysics. However, politics
were quite enough to make them all lose their
tempers; though they all, whether they belonged
to the Right or the Left, were in full agreement
on this essential principle: “Property is the only
good thing in the world, and the ownership of
land is the only thing worth living for. Must
we give up anything and, if so, how much?”</p>

<p>Thérèse, “who had property in her blood,”
was quite willing for the question to be put in
that cynical way, but she hated the pretences
under which the Larroques and the La Traves
masked their common greed. When her father
announced his “irrevocable devotion” to democracy,
she would interrupt him, with “Oh, spare
us that sort of thing; we are all friends here.”
She said that lofty sentiments in politics made
her feel sick: the horror of the class-war was not
very obvious in a country where the poorest own
property, and their only ambition is to own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
more: where the common love of land, sport,
eating and drinking, draws every one together,
middle-class and peasant, in the closest fellowship.
Moreover, Bernard had some education:
he was generally considered a very promising
young man, and Thérèse even congratulated herself
on the fact that he was a man one could
talk to: “A good deal above the average in fact.”
Such was the view she took of him until the
day of her meeting with Jean Azévédo.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the time of year when the coolness of
the night lasts through the morning: and by the
early afternoon, hot as the sun had been, a faint
mist foretold the dusk. The first pigeons were
beginning to come over, and Bernard hardly ever
came home before evening. On that day, however,
after a bad night, he had gone straight off
to Bordeaux to get himself examined.</p>

<p>“I was feeling at peace with the world,”
thought Thérèse: “I was walking along the road,
I forget at what time, because a woman who is
going to have a baby ought to take a little exercise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
I avoided the woods where shooting was
going on because you have to stop every minute,
whistle, and wait until you hear a shout for you
to go on: but sometimes a long whistle answers
yours: a flight of birds has settled among the
oaks, and you must crouch down and wait. Then
I came back: I was dozing in front of the fire
in the drawing-room or the kitchen, and Aunt
Clara was bringing me anything I wanted. I
paid no more attention to the old creature, who
was always droning out stories about the kitchen
and the farm, than a goddess does to her serving-maid:
she talked and talked so as not to have
to try and listen: mostly depressing anecdotes
about the peasants whom she looked after with
a sort of cynical kindness: old men who could do
no more than die of hunger, others condemned
to work until they died, sick men with none to
care for them, and women broken by toil and
exhaustion. Aunt Clara quoted some of their
most shocking remarks in the ingenuous rustic
patois, with a sort of amusement. As a matter
of fact, I was the only person she cared for,
though I never even noticed her kneel down,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
unlace my shoes, take off my stockings, and warm
my feet with her old hands.</p>

<p>“Balion came for orders when he was going
in to Saint Clair on the following day. Aunt
Clara drew up the list of commissions, and put
together the prescriptions for the sick of
Argelouse. ‘You will go to the chemist in the
first place; Darquey will want quite the whole
day to make them all up....’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“My first meeting with Jean.... I must
remember every detail: I had decided to go to
that deserted shooting-hut where I used to eat
my lunch with Anne and where I knew, since
then, she had so loved to meet her Azévédo.
No, I did not look upon it as a pilgrimage. But
the pines in that neighbourhood have grown so
tall that it is no longer possible to watch for
pigeons there, so I ran no risk of disturbing the
sportsmen. That shooting-hut was useless now,
for the surrounding forest hid the horizon; the
tree-tops were no longer far enough apart to reveal
those broad vistas of sky against which the
watcher sees the rising flights of birds. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
well I remember: the October sun was still hot:
I toiled along that sandy road, tormented by
flies. And how heavy I felt! I longed to sit
down on the mouldering bench inside the hut.”</p>

<p>As I opened the door a young man came out,
bareheaded; at the first glance I recognised Jean
Azévédo, and at first I thought I was intruding
on a rendezvous, his expression looked so confused.
I wanted to go away but he would not
let me; it was strange that he was so intent on
my remaining: ‘Not at all, please come in,
Madame; I assure you that you are not disturbing
me in the least.’ Why did he ask me if one
could see from outside what was going on inside
the hut? I was astonished that there was no
one there when I went in, as he insisted. Perhaps
the shepherdess had fled by another exit?
But I had not heard the rustle of a single twig.
He, too, had recognised me, and he was the
first to mention Anne de la Trave’s name. I
was sitting down; he standing up, just as in the
photograph. I looked through his tussore shirt
at the place where I had stuck the pin: mere
curiosity, without any warmer feeling; I remembered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
without the slightest irritation what
Anne had written to me: ‘I press my hand
against the place where I can feel his heart beating
... what he calls the last caress allowed.’
Handsome? A high forehead, the velvet eyes
of his <span class="lock">race,—cheeks</span> too <span class="lock">large;—and,</span> what I so
dislike in young men of his <span class="lock">age,—spots,</span> the signs
of overheated blood; a general unpleasant
clamminess; and worst of all, moist <span class="lock">palms,—which</span>
he had to wipe with a handkerchief before
shaking hands. But he had fine burning eyes,
and I liked his wide mouth, always a little open
to display his pointed teeth, like a puppy panting
with the heat.</p>

<p>And how did I behave? I was very strong
on the family, I remember. I already tried to
be very severe and accused him in grave tones,
‘of bringing distress and dissension into an
honourable household.’ Heavens! how I remember
his amazement, his boyish burst of
laughter: ‘So you think I want to marry her?
You think I aspire to that honour?’ I was astounded
as I measured with a glance the abyss
between Anne’s infatuation and the young man’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
indifference. He defended himself vigorously:
why on earth should he not yield to the charm
of a delightful child? He was not aware that
flirtations were forbidden, and just because there
could not be the slightest question of marriage
between them, this one had seemed to him quite
innocuous. Of course, he had pretended to share
Anne’s intentions.... And when I tried to
wave all this haughtily aside, he vehemently
burst out that Anne herself could bear him witness
that he had been careful not to go too far;
that in any case he was quite sure that Mademoiselle
de la Trave owed him the only hours
of true passion that she was likely to know in
her dreary existence: ‘You tell me she is unhappy,
Madame; but do you think that she has
anything better to look forward to than this same
unhappiness? I know you by reputation: I know
you aren’t like the people round here, and I can
talk to you frankly. Before she sets out on her
dreadful voyage in one of those old houses of
Saint Clair I have provided Anne with a stock
of sensations and <span class="lock">dreams,—enough</span> to save her,
perhaps, from despair and, in any case, from becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
brutalised.’ I forget if I was irritated
by this shocking conceit and affectation, or even
if I noticed it. As a matter of fact he spoke so
quickly that at first I did not follow what he said;
but my mind soon got used to his flow of speech:
‘Fancy thinking I could possibly want such a
marriage; settle down in this sandy desert, or
burden myself with a girl of her age in Paris?
I shall always have the most delightful recollections
of Anne; and at the moment, when you
surprised me, I was indeed thinking of her....
But how can one tie oneself down, Madame?
Each minute should bring its own <span class="lock">joy,—and</span> a
different one.’</p>

<p>“This combination of intelligence and the
greed of a young animal in one and the same
being seemed so strange to me that I listened
without interrupting him. Yes, I was certainly
fascinated: cheaply enough, in all conscience, but
I was. I remember the trampling of hooves, the
tinkling of bells, the wild cries of the shepherds
which announced the approach of a herd of
cattle. I told the young man that our being together
in the hut might perhaps seem odd: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
I wanted him to answer that it would be best
to keep quiet until the herd had passed; I should
have enjoyed the silence side by side, the feeling
that we shared a secret (for I, too, was becoming
exacting, and wanted each minute to
bring me something that would help me to live).
But Jean Azévédo opened the door of the hut
without protest and politely withdrew. He only
followed me to Argelouse after having made
certain that I saw no objection in it. How
quickly we seemed to get home again, although
my companion found the time to touch on many
subjects: and he threw a strangely fresh light
on those I thought I knew something of: on
the religious question, for instance; as I was
repeating what I used to say at home, he broke
in: ‘Yes, no doubt ... but it’s more complicated
than that....’ Indeed, some of his remarks
seemed admirably new and illuminating....
Were they really so admirable?... I am
pretty sure I should think it all poor stuff to-day:
he said that he had long believed that nothing
was of any importance except the search for,
the pursuit of, God: ‘One must set forth across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the sea; and avoid like the plague those who
think they have found what they want, settle
down, and build themselves shelters to sleep in;
I have long despised them....’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“He asked me if I had read the <cite>Life of Father
de Foucauld</cite> by René Bazin: and as I pretended
to laugh, he assured me that the book had been
a revelation to him: ‘Perhaps,’ he added, ‘to
live dangerously, in the deeper meaning of the
words, lies not so much in seeking God, as in
finding Him, and having discovered Him, living
within His orbit.’ He described to me, ‘the
great adventure of the mystics,’ and complained
of his temperament that prevented him attempting
it; ‘he could not remember having ever been
pure.’ Such shamelessness, such absence of reserve,
was such an utter change from our rustic
caution, the silence which we all maintain about
our inner life. The gossip of Saint Clair does
not go below the surface: hearts are never laid
bare. What do I really know about Bernard?
There must be infinitely more in him than that
caricature which seems adequate when I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
to bring him to mind. Jean talked, and I said
nothing: nothing came to my lips but the usual
phrases of our family discussions. Just as in
these parts, all the vehicles are built to the same
gauge, that is to say, broad enough for the wheels
to fit exactly into the ruts made by the farm
carts, all my thoughts until that day had been
built to fit the mental gauge of my father and
my parents-in-law. Jean Azévédo was wearing
no hat. I can still see his shirt open over his boyish
chest, his rather heavy neck. Was I physically
attracted at all? Oh, no, indeed! But he
was the first man I had met for whom the life
of the mind counted above everything. His
masters, his Paris friends, whose sayings or
whose books he so constantly mentioned, prevented
my thinking of him as in any way unique:
he was one of a large and distinguished company,—‘those
who live,’ as he called them. He
quoted names, not imagining for a moment that
I might not know them; and I pretended that it
was not the first time I had heard them.</p>

<p>“When the fields of Argelouse came into sight
at the turn of the road: ‘Already!’ I cried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Smoke from burning grass drifted over the surface
of the desolate soil now barren of its rye;
through a gap in the embankment poured a herd
of cattle looking like a stream of dirty milk,
and they wandered off over the sandy heath.
Jean had to cross the fields, to reach Vilméja,
and I said: ‘I’ll come with you: I’ve been so
thrilled by all this.’ But we found no more to
say to each other. The rye stubble hurt me
through my country sandals. I had the feeling
that he wanted to be alone, no doubt to follow
up at leisure some thought that had come to him.
I pointed out that we had not talked about
Anne; he assured me that we were not free to
choose the subjects of our conversations, nor
even of our meditations: ‘or else,’ he said loftily,
‘one would have to submit to the methods invented
by the mystics.... Creatures like ourselves
always are borne upon the stream, and
walk down inevitable slopes....’ He related
everything, in fact, to what he was reading at
the moment. We agreed to meet again to
arrange some method of dealing with the question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
of Anne. He talked absent-mindedly, and
when I asked him a question, did not answer:
suddenly he bent down, and with a boyish gesture
picked a mushroom, showed it me, and then
put it to his nose and lips.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernard</span> was on the door-step waiting for
Thérèse to return: “There’s nothing wrong with
me at all,” he shouted, as soon as he saw her
dress in the darkness: “Can you imagine that a
man of my physique could be anæmic? It’s incredible,
but I am: you can’t rely on appearances:
I’m to follow a treatment ... the Fowler
treatment: It’s arsenic ... the main thing is to
get back my appetite.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thérèse remembered that she had felt no irritation
at first: everything connected with Bernard
seemed to make less impression on her
than usual (as if the blow had been dealt her
from further off). She did not hear him: for
her body and her soul were turned towards another
world full of eager creatures who wanted to
know and to <span class="lock">understand,—and,</span> in a phrase which
Jean had repeated with an air of deep satisfaction,
“to become what they really were.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
when at dinner, she at last mentioned her meeting,
Bernard cried, “Why, you hadn’t said anything
about it: what an odd girl you are! Well,
and what did you decide?”</p>

<p>She devised on the spot the plan which was,
in fact, adopted. Jean Azévédo agreed to write
a letter to Anne in which he would contrive as
gently as possible to make it clear that all was
over. Bernard had jeered when Thérèse had
maintained that the young man did not want
the marriage in the least: an Azévédo not want
to marry Anne de la Trave! “Why, you must
be mad! He knows very well there’s nothing
doing: people like that don’t take a risk when
they know they must lose. You’re still very
simple-minded, my child.”</p>

<p>Bernard would not have the lamp lit because
of the mosquitoes; so he did not see Thérèse’s
look. “He had recovered his appetite,” as he
said. The Bordeaux doctor had saved his life
already.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Did I see Jean Azévédo many times after
that? He left Argelouse about the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
October.... We took perhaps five or six walks
together; the only one that stands out was the
one we spent in concocting the letter to Anne.
The simple-minded youth insisted on what he
thought were soothing, pacifying phrases: of
course I could see how dreadful they were,
though I did not say so. But our last expeditions
are all confused in one single memory. Jean
Azévédo described Paris and his friends to me,
and I imagined a kingdom in which the law was
self-realization. ‘Here you are condemned to
deceit until you die.’ Did he speak such words
intentionally? Of what did he suspect me? He
thought I should never stand that stifling atmosphere:
‘Look,’ he said, ‘at the vast level frozen
surface under which every soul in this place is
embedded: sometimes it cracks and you can see
the dark water beneath: some one has struggled
and disappeared; the ice sets again.... Yet
here, too, each one is born with his own law
within him: here, too, each man’s destiny is his
alone; and yet you are all victims of this same
gloomy fate. Some resist: hence the tragedies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
about which our families do not talk. There is
a great deal about which we do not talk!’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed, yes,’ I cried. ‘I have sometimes
asked about some great-uncle or grandfather,
whose photographs have disappeared from all
the albums, and I have never got any answer
except once, when I was told: ‘He disappeared:
he was forced to disappear.’”</p>

<p>“Did Jean Azévédo dread this destiny for me?
He assured me that it would have never occurred
to him to talk about such matters to Anne, because
apart from her affections, she was quite a
simple soul, with little power of resistance, and
would soon have sunk into slavery: ‘But you! I
feel in all your words a hunger and thirst for
truth.’ Shall I report faithfully all these conversations
to Bernard? It is madness to hope
that he would understand a word of them. He
must realise, in any case, that I did not surrender
without a struggle. I remember arguing
against the lad that he was adorning with clever
phrases what in fact was moral degradation. I
even had recourse to memories of the lectures
on ethics at the <i>Lycée</i>. ‘Self-realisation?’ I repeated:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
‘but we only exist in so far as we make
ourselves what we are.’ Azévédo denied that
there was any degradation worse than that of
self-betrayal. He maintained there was not a
hero nor a saint, who had but once or twice explored
the mysteries of his soul, without soon
reaching all its limits: ‘We must go beyond ourselves
to find God,’ he would say. And again:
‘To accept ourselves as we are, compels the best
among us to meet ourselves face to face, openly
and in fair fight. And that is why it often happens
that these enlightened souls become converted
to the narrowest creed.’”</p>

<p>She would not discuss with Bernard the justification
for this morality;—she would even
admit that these were doubtless the feeblest
sophisms; “but he must understand, he must
make an effort to understand, how deeply a
woman like myself could be affected by them
and what I felt in the evening in the dining-room
at Argelouse: Bernard, ensconced in the
neighbouring kitchen, was taking off his boots,
and relating in dialect the result of the day’s
shooting. The captive pigeons struggled in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
heaving bag on the table: Bernard ate slowly,
full of the joy of his reconquered <span class="lock">appetite,—lovingly</span>
counted out the drops of ‘Fowler’:
‘That is health,’ he used to say. There was a
large fire burning and at dessert he had only to
turn his chair to stretch out his feet, in their
felt shoes, to the flames. His eyes closed over
<cite>La Petite Gironde</cite>. Sometimes he snored, but
as often as not I did not even hear him breathe.
Balionte’s slippers still shuffled about the kitchen;
then she brought in the candlesticks. After that,
silence: the silence of Argelouse. People who
do not know those deserted moors do not know
what silence is: it encircles the house as if embodied
in that thick mass of forest in which nothing
lives, except from time to time a hooting owl
(we seem to be listening in the night to the
sound of the sob we dare not utter).</p>

<p>“It was more especially after Azévédo’s departure
that I became acquainted with that silence.
So long as I knew that when it was
daylight Jean would come once more, his presence
robbed the outer darkness of its terror:
while he slept near by, the moor and the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
were populous. The moment he had left
Argelouse, after that last conversation when he
arranged to meet me in a year’s time, full of
hope, he said, that I should then know how to
free myself (I still do not know whether in this
he spoke lightly, or whether he meant more than
he said. I rather suspect that our young friend
from Paris could not endure the silence, the
silence of Argelouse, and that his regard for me
was a regard for the only available audience), as
soon as I had left him, I felt as though I was
entering an endless tunnel, plunging into a darkness
that grew ever thicker: and sometimes I
wondered whether I should reach the open air
before I were suffocated. Until my baby was
born, in January, nothing more happened.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Here, Thérèse hesitated: and she tried to detach
her thoughts from what took place in the
house at Argelouse the day following Jean’s departure:
“No,” she thought: “that has nothing to
do with what I shall soon have to explain to
Bernard; I have no time to lose on trails that
lead nowhere.” But the thought would not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
dismissed; it haunted her mind. Thérèse will
never destroy the memory of that October evening.
Bernard was going to bed on the first floor:
Thérèse was waiting until the log was quite burnt
out before she joined <span class="lock">him,—happy</span> to be alone
for a moment: what was Jean Azévédo doing at
that hour? Perhaps he was drinking in that little
bar he had told her about, or perhaps (the night
was so warm) he was driving in a motor-car, with
a friend, through the deserted Bois de Boulogne.
Perhaps he was working at his table, while Paris
murmured far away: the silence was his own
handiwork,—he had won it against the turmoil
of the world: it was not imposed on him from
without like the silence which was stifling
Thérèse: it was his own, and reached no further
than the light of the lamp, or the shelves packed
with books.... Such were Thérèse’s thoughts,
when suddenly the dog barked, then began to
howl, and a familiar, but exhausted voice soothed
him outside in the vestibule. Anne de la Trave
opened the door: she had walked from Saint
Clair in the <span class="lock">dark—her</span> shoes were full of mud.
Her eyes blazed in her worn little face. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
flung her hat on to a chair: and asked: “Where
is he?”</p>

<p>Thérèse and Jean, when the letter had been
written and posted, had thought the affair was
over,—far from supposing that Anne would not
let <span class="lock">go,—just</span> as if any human creature listened
to reasons or to reasonings, when its whole life
was at stake! She had succeeded in eluding her
mother and got into a train. She had made her
way along the dark Argelouse road by the strip
of clear sky between the tree-tops. “She must
see him again: if she could see him again, he was
hers once more: she <em>must</em> see him.” She had
stumbled along, twisting her feet in the cart
tracks, she was in such a hurry to reach Argelouse.
Thérèse told her that Jean was gone and was now
in Paris. Anne shook her head, she did not believe
it: she could not let herself believe it, if
she was not to collapse with fatigue and despair:</p>

<p>“You are lying as you have always lied.”</p>

<p>And as Thérèse protested, she added:</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got the family spirit with a vengeance!
You pose as emancipated, but since
your marriage you’ve become a woman of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
family, pretty quick.... Yes, yes, of course,
you did it for the best: you betrayed me to save
me, didn’t you? I will spare you your explanations.”
As she was opening the door, Thérèse
asked her where she was going.</p>

<p>“To Vilméja, to his house.”</p>

<p>“I tell you he left it two days ago.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you.”</p>

<p>She went out; Thérèse then lit the lantern
hanging in the entrance hall and went out after
her:</p>

<p>“You’re going wrong, my little Anne: you’re
on the road to Biourge. Vilméja is over there.”</p>

<p>They made their way through the mist. Dogs
began to bark. The oaks of Vilméja at last,
and the house, not asleep, but dead. Anne
prowled round the empty sepulchre, and hammered
on the door with both fists. Thérèse,
standing motionless, had put the lantern down
on the grass. She watched her friend’s slender
ghost clinging to each window on the ground
floor. Anne was no doubt whispering a name
to herself, but not calling it aloud, for she knew
that it was quite useless. For a few moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
she was hidden behind the building; then she reappeared,
went up to the door, and sank down
upon the threshold, and hid her face in her
knees which she clasped with her arms. Thérèse
lifted her up and led her away. Anne kept on
saying, as she stumbled along: “I shall go to
Paris to-morrow morning: Paris is not so very
big: I shall find him in Paris....” But she
spoke like an exhausted child who had already
given up hope.</p>

<p>Bernard, awakened by the sound of their
voices, had put on a dressing-gown and was waiting
for them in the drawing-room. Thérèse
was wrong to banish the memory of that scene
that broke out between brother and sister. This
man, who could seize a poor worn-out child so
roughly by the wrists, drag her up to a room on
the second floor, and bolt the door, is your husband,
Thérèse: that Bernard, who, in two hours’
time, will be your judge. The spirit of the family
inspired him, and not for one instant did he
waver. He always knew, in every sort of situation,
what was due to the family. You, in the
agony of your remorse, Thérèse, are preparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
a long appeal: but only men with no principles
can listen to a reason that is not their own. Bernard
will laugh at your arguments: “I know
what I have to do.” He always knows what he
has to do. If he sometimes hesitates, he says:
“The family have discussed it and we have decided
that....” How can you doubt that he
has prepared his sentence: Your destiny is fixed
for ever: you may as well go to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the La Traves had brought Anne back,
defeated, to Saint Clair Thérèse had not left
Argelouse until just before her baby was born.
She knew the silence of the place only too well
during those interminable November nights. A
letter addressed to Jean Azévédo had remained
unanswered. He doubtless considered that this
country-bred creature was not worth the trouble
of a correspondence. In the first place, a pregnant
woman is never an agreeable recollection.
Perhaps, at a distance, this foolish fellow, who
would have been captivated by poses and sham
complications, thought her dull. But what could
he understand of that deceptive simplicity of
mind, that frank expression, those bold unhesitating
gestures? In point of fact, he believed
her capable, like little Anne, of taking him at
his word, and leaving everything for his sake.
Jean Azévédo mistrusted women who surrendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
too soon to give the assailant time to
raise the siege. Nothing dismayed him so much
as victory, and the fruits of victory. Yet
Thérèse made an effort to live in this young
man’s world: but some books which Jean admired,
and which she had got from Bordeaux,
she could not understand. How empty her life
was! She was not to be asked to work at baby-linen:
“That was not her business,” Madame de
la Trave used to say. Many women die in childbirth
in the country. Thérèse made Aunt Clara
cry by assuring her that she would end like her
mother, that she was certain she would not escape.
She did not fail to add that she was content to
die: which was untrue! She had never longed
so ardently to live: nor had Bernard ever displayed
so much solicitude for her. “He was not
concerned about me, but about what I carried
within me. He used to say, in his dreadful accent:
‘Have some more soup ... don’t eat any
fish ... you have walked enough to-day....’
I did not care: I was no more touched than a
foreign nurse might be who is pampered for the
quality of her milk. The La Traves revered in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
me a sacred vessel: the mould which held their
offspring; there was not a doubt that, if necessity
arose, they would have sacrificed me to the
life I held within me. I lost the feeling of individual
existence. I was nothing more than
the branch that bore the fruit which, in the family’s
opinion, was all that counted.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Until the end of December we had to live
in darkness. And as if the darkness of the pines
were not enough, rain unceasing encompassed the
gloomy house with its myriad moving rods.
When the only road to Saint Clair threatened to
become impassable, I was conveyed into the town,
where the house was hardly less dark than that
of Argelouse. The old plane trees on the Square
still defended their leaves against the gusts of
wind and rain. Aunt Clara, who could not live
anywhere but at Argelouse, was not able to look
after me: but she often made the journey, in any
sort of weather, in her rustic dog-cart, and
brought me all those little dainties that I used
to be so fond of as a girl, and that she thought
I still liked, little grey balls of rye and honey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
called <i lang="fr">miques</i>: and the cake that goes by the
name of <i lang="fr">fougasse</i> or <i lang="fr">roumadjade</i>. I only saw
Anne at meals, and she never spoke to me now:
resigned, so it would seem, and broken, she had
lost all her youthful freshness at a blow. Her
hair, drawn too far back, revealed ugly pallid
ears. The Deguilhem boy’s name was not mentioned,
but Madame de la Trave asserted that if
Anne did not yet say yes, neither did she say no.
Ah! Jean had judged her rightly: it had not
taken long to bridle her and break her in. Bernard
was not so well because he had begun to
drink <i lang="fr">aperitifs</i> again.</p>

<p>“What did these creatures round me talk
about? They discussed the clergyman a great
deal, I remember (we lived opposite the presbytery).
They wondered, for instance, ‘why he
had crossed the Square six times in the course of
the day, and each time he had had to come back
a different way.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As a result of certain remarks of Jean Azévédo,
Thérèse paid a little more attention to the priest,
who was still young, and not on good terms with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
his parishioners who found him stand-offish:
“He’s not the kind we want here”: In the course
of his rare visits to the La Traves, Thérèse noticed
his white temples and high forehead. He
had no friends. How did he spend his evenings?
Why had he chosen this life? “He is very punctilious,”
said Madame de la Trave: “He prays
every evening: but he is wanting in unction. I
don’t think he is genuinely devout. He doesn’t
really do anything in the Parish.” She deplored
the fact that he had given up the Church Lads’
Brigade: and the parents complained that he did
not go with the children to the football-field.
“It’s all very well for him to be buried in his
books, but a Parish soon goes to pieces.” Thérèse
used to go to church to hear him preach (“My
dear, you’ve decided to go just when your condition
would have excused you”). The Curé’s
sermons, which dealt with dogma or morals, were
impersonal. But Thérèse was struck by an intonation,
a gesture, or a word that seemed specially
significant.... Ah! perhaps he could
have helped her to unravel the confusion of her
soul: unlike the rest, his also had been a tragic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
rôle: to his own inner solitude was added the
isolation that the cassock brings upon its wearer.
What comfort did he draw from those daily rites?
Thérèse would have liked to have been present
at Mass during the week when, with no other
witness but a choir-boy, he bent muttering over
a piece of bread. But such a proceeding would
have seemed odd to her family and the neighbours,
who would have raised the cry of “Conversion.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Much as Thérèse suffered at that time, it was
just after the birth of the child that she began
to find life really unendurable. There was no
outward sign of this, no scene between Bernard
and herself: and she behaved with more deference
to her parents-in-law than her husband himself.
There lay the tragedy: there had been no
reason for a rupture: it was impossible to conceive
an event that would have prevented things
taking the course that led to death. Misunderstanding
presupposes some common ground of
conflict; but Thérèse never came into contact with
Bernard and still less with her parents-in-law;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
their words barely reached her: she hardly conceived
it necessary to answer them. Had they
even a vocabulary in common? They attached a
different meaning to the most unimportant words.
If Thérèse was ever tempted into saying something
she really meant, the family had agreed,
once and for all, that the poor child could not
resist a paradox. “I pretend not to hear,”
Madame de la Trave used to say: “and if she
persists, not to take any notice. She knows it’s
no good trying it on us.”</p>

<p>None the less, Madame de la Trave found it
hard to tolerate Thérèse’s affectation of hating
people to exclaim over her likeness to little Marie.
The usual cries of “She’s the very image of you!...”
produced violent reactions which she could
not always conceal. “She’s not like me in the
least,” she would insist. “Look at her dark skin,
and jet-black eyes: you can see from my photographs
I was pale when I was a baby.”</p>

<p>She would not have it that Marie was like
her. She refused to possess anything in common
with this flesh that had now parted company
with her own. People began to be aware that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
she was not exactly remarkable for her maternal
affection. But Madame de la Trave maintained
that she loved her daughter in her own way:
“Of course we can’t expect her to bathe the child
or change her napkins: that wouldn’t be like
her: but I have seen her sit for a whole evening
by the cradle, not smoking, so as to watch the
baby asleep.... Besides, we have a very reliable
nurse: and then Anne is there. Ah! She’ll
make a wonderful little mother....” It was
true that, since a child had come into the house,
Anne had begun to live again. A cradle always
attracts women: but Anne especially loved to
look after the infant. So as to have freer access
to her, she had made peace with Thérèse, though
nothing remained of their old affection but certain
familiarities of address. The girl particularly
dreaded Thérèse’s maternal jealousy: “The
child knows me better than her mother: she
laughs as soon as she sees me. The other day,
I had her in my arms; she began to scream as
soon as Thérèse wanted to take her. She likes
me so much better that I feel quite embarrassed
sometimes....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Anne need not have felt embarrassed. At
that moment in her life, Thérèse felt as aloof
from her daughter as from everything else. She
saw human beings and inanimate things, her own
body and even her mind, like a mirage or vapour
suspended outside her. In this void, Bernard
alone assumed a dreadful reality: his corpulence,
his nasal voice, his peremptory tone, his self-satisfaction.
If she could only get away....
But how? And where? Thérèse was overcome
by the first heat of summer. She had not the
slightest presentiment of what she was about to
do. What did happen that year? She could not
remember a single incident, a single quarrel: she
remembered having loathed her husband more
than usual, on the day of Corpus Christi, when
she watched the procession through the half-closed
shutters. Bernard was almost the only
man behind the canopy. The village had become
a desert in a few moments, just as if there had
been a lion, not a lamb, let loose in the streets....
People went behind doors so as not to be
obliged to take their hats off or fall on their
knees. Once the danger had passed, the doors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
began to open one by one. Thérèse observed the
Curé, who was walking with his eyes nearly shut,
carrying the strange object in both his hands. His
lips moved: to whom was he speaking with that
dejected air? And immediately behind him
walked Bernard, “doing his duty as usual.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Weeks followed without a drop of rain. Bernard
lived in terror of fires, and his heart was
troubling him again. More than twelve hundred
acres had been burnt in the Louchat district:
“If the wind had been in the north my
Balisac pines would have been done for.”
Thérèse waited for some blow to fall from that
unchanging sky. It would never rain any more....
One day the whole forest round them would
burst into crackling flames, and even the town
would not escape. How is it that the villages
in the Landes country are never burnt down?
She thought it unfair that the flames should always
fall upon the pines and never on the human
population. At home, there were endless discussions
on the causes of the disaster: a cigarette-end
very likely, or perhaps some one had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
it for revenge? Thérèse dreamt that she got up
one night, went into the forest where the undergrowth
was thickest, threw away her cigarette, and
waited until the sky of dawn was darkened with
vast clouds of smoke.... But she banished the
thought, for love of the pines was in her blood:
it was not upon the trees that her hatred lay.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The time had now come when she must face
the act she had committed. What explanation
should she give to Bernard? She could only remind
him, point by point, how the thing happened.
It was the day of the great fire at Mano.
Various men came into the dining-room where
the family were having a hasty lunch. Some said
that the fire seemed a very long way from Saint
Clair: others insisted that the tocsin should be
rung. The torrid air was full of the smell of
burning resin and the face of the sun looked
dull and tarnished. Thérèse saw Bernard once
more, sitting with his head turned, listening to
Balion’s report, and his strong hairy hand poised
absent-mindedly above the glass as the “Fowler’s
drops” fell into the water. He swallowed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
physic at a gulp before Thérèse, who was stupefied
with the heat, had thought to warn him that
he had doubled his usual dose. Every one but
herself had left the table; she stayed on, cracking
almonds, indifferent, untouched by all this
anxiety, without interest in the tragedy, as indeed
in any tragedy that was not her own. The
tocsin did not ring. Bernard came back at last:
“For once you were right not to be anxious: the
fire is over towards Mano.... Have I taken
my drops?” he asked, and without waiting for
the answer he began again to pour them out into
his glass. She said nothing, no doubt from laziness
or fatigue; what was her intention in that
instant? “I couldn’t have really meant not to
answer.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And yet that night, when Doctor Pédemay
questioned her on the incidents of the day, as
she stood by Bernard’s bedside, where he lay
vomiting and groaning, she did not mention what
she had seen at table. It would, however, have
been easy, without compromising herself, to have
reminded the doctor about the arsenic which Bernard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
was taking. She might have said something
of this sort: “I did not think about it at the moment....
We were all distracted by the fire
... but I would swear, now, that he took a
double dose....” She remained dumb: she
did not even feel moved to speak. The deed
which during lunch had been unwitting began
then to emerge from the depths of her <span class="lock">being,—as</span>
yet incomplete, but half-endured with consciousness.</p>

<p>After the doctor’s departure she had watched
Bernard as he lay asleep at last: she thought to
herself: “There is nothing to prove it was <em>that</em>;
it may be an attack of appendicitis, though there
were no other symptoms ... or an attack of
gastric influenza.” But Bernard was up again
two days later. “It looks as if it must have been
<em>that</em>.” Thérèse would not have sworn to it; she
would like to have been sure. “Yes, I had no
sort of feeling of being at the mercy of a horrible
temptation: it was merely a matter of
curiosity rather dangerous to satisfy. The first
day on which I poured the ‘Fowler’s drops’ into
his glass, before he came into the room, I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
saying to myself: ‘Just once, so as to
make quite sure.... I shall know if it was
that which made him ill. Just once and no
more.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The train slowed down, whistled for some
time, and then moved on again. Two or three
lights in the distance: Saint Clair station. But
Thérèse’s self-examination was at an end: she
had taken the plunge and the dark waters had
closed over her head. What followed was murder,
and Bernard knew as much about it as she
did: the sudden recurrence of his trouble, and
Thérèse watching over him day and night, although
she seemed at the end of her strength and
incapable of swallowing anything, so much so
that he persuaded her to try the Fowler treatment,
and she got a prescription from Doctor
Pédemay! Poor Doctor! He was astonished
by the greenish liquid that Bernard brought up:
he would not have believed that there could be
such a discrepancy between an invalid’s pulse and
his temperature: he had many times observed, in
cases of para-typhoid, a regular pulse, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
a high degree of fever;—but what
could be the meaning of this violent pulse with
a temperature below the normal?... Gastric
influenza, no doubt (influenza covers everything).</p>

<p>Madame de la Trave contemplated calling in
an eminent consultant but did not want to hurt
the doctor’s feelings as he was an old friend;
besides, Thérèse was afraid of giving Bernard a
shock. Still, about the middle of August, after
a more than usually alarming attack, Pédemay
of his own accord asked for a second opinion;
fortunately, on the very next day Bernard was
better: and three weeks later they were talking
of convalescence.</p>

<p>“A fortunate escape,” said Pédemay. “If
there had been time to call in the great man, he
would have got all the credit for the case.”</p>

<p>Bernard had himself taken to Argelouse, in
the conviction that the pigeon-shooting would
cure him. Thérèse was much exhausted about
this time: Aunt Clara was in bed with an acute
attack of rheumatism: two invalids and one child
to look after, not to mention all Aunt Clara’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
various avocations that had to be attended to.
Thérèse took particular care to see that the
Argelouse poor did not suffer from the aunt’s
illness. She went around to all the farms, and,
just as her aunt did, saw that all the prescriptions
were made up, and paid for the medicines out of
her own pocket. It did not occur to her to be
depressed because the Vilméja farm was shut.
She thought no more of Azévédo, nor of any
one at all. She was travelling alone through a
tunnel at lightning speed, and she was at the
darkest point. She must not think: she must
dash, like an animal, through the darkness and
smoke and get out into the free air once more.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At the beginning of December Bernard was
again laid up with the same complaint: one
morning he awoke shivering, his legs lifeless and
cold. Ah, what happened then! A consultant
fetched one evening from Bordeaux by Monsieur
de la Trave: his long silence after he had examined
the sick man (Thérèse held the lamp and
Balionte still remembers that she looked whiter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
than the sheets): on the dim landing, Pédemay,
lowering his voice in case Thérèse might be
listening, explaining to his colleague that Darquey
the chemist, had shown him two of his
prescriptions falsified: on the first a criminal
hand had added: <cite>Fowler drops</cite>; on the other
appeared fairly large doses of chloroform, digitaline
and aconitine. Balion had brought them
to the pharmacy together with many others.
Darquey, in a panic at having sent out these
poisons, rushed round the next day to see Pédemay....
Yes, Bernard knew all this as well as
Thérèse herself. He had been hurriedly conveyed
in an ambulance to a nursing-home at
Bordeaux: and from that day he had begun to
get well. Thérèse had remained alone at
Argelouse; but lonely as she was, she was aware
of a kind of vast and ominous murmur bearing
down on her, and she crouched like an animal
that hears the hounds drawing near; she felt as
if she had been brought down in a frantic <span class="lock">race,—as</span>
if when near the goal, her hand already outstretched
to clasp it, she had been suddenly dashed
to the ground and both her legs broken. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
father had come one evening, and begged her to
make a clean breast of it: all might yet be saved.
Pédemay had agreed to withdraw his charge,
and pretended to be no longer sure whether one
of the prescriptions was not entirely from his
hand. As for the aconitine, chloroform and
digitaline, he could not have prescribed such
heavy doses: but since no trace of them had been
found in the patient’s blood....</p>

<p>Thérèse remembered the scene with her
father, by Aunt Clara’s bed. The room was lit
up by a wood fire; none of them wanted a lamp.
In her monotonous childish voice she delivered a
lesson, the lesson that she went over again and
again during her sleepless nights. “I met a
man on the road who did not come from Argelouse,
and who said to me that since I was sending
some one to Darquey’s, he hoped I would
not mind sending his prescriptions too: he owed
money to Darquey and did not want to go to the
shop.... He promised to come to the house
for the medicine, but he did not tell me his name
nor his address....”</p>

<p>“Try to think of something else, Thérèse, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
God’s sake, for the sake of the family: wretched
woman, try to think of something else.”</p>

<p>Old Larroque repeated his adjurations with
obstinate emphasis; the deaf woman, half raised
upon her pillows, and feeling that a mortal
menace was weighing on Thérèse, groaned out:
“What is he saying to you? What do they want
you to do? Why are they hurting you?”</p>

<p>She had found enough strength to smile at
her aunt and hold her hand, while, like a little
girl at her catechism, she recited: “It was a man
on the road: it was too dark for me to see his
face; he did not say what farm he belonged
to....”</p>

<p>He had come another evening for the medicine;
but unfortunately no one in the house had
seen his face.</p>

<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER <abbr title="Nine">IX</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Clair</span>, at last. No one recognised
Thérèse as she got out of the carriage. While
Balion was giving up her tickets she went round
outside the station through some stacks of timber
and got on to the road where the carriage was
waiting.</p>

<p>This carriage had become her refuge; along
that jolting road she was no longer afraid of
meeting any one. Her whole story, so carefully
constructed, collapsed: nothing remained of the
confession she had prepared. No; she had nothing
to say in her defence, not even a reason to
give: the simplest thing would be to say nothing,
or merely answer questions. What had she
to fear? That night would pass like all the rest:
the sun would rise to-morrow: she was sure all
would be well whatever happened. And nothing
could be worse than that indifference, that
utter apathy that cut her off from the world and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
from her very existence. It was truly death in
life: she had tasted death as far as a living
woman may.</p>

<p>Her eyes, now accustomed to the darkness,
recognised at a turn of the road the farm where
certain low buildings looked like animals crouching
and asleep. It was here that Anne used to
be frightened of a dog that would always run
under the wheels of her bicycle. Further on, a
clump of elders revealed a glimpse of water; and
on the days of fiercest heat a breath of coolness
fanned the girl’s cheeks at this point. A child
on a bicycle, whose teeth gleamed under her sunbonnet,
the sound of a bell, and a voice crying:
“Look, I’m letting both my hands go!” And
this blurred image, from those days now past
for ever, was all that Thérèse could find to comfort
her fainting heart.</p>

<p>She repeated mechanically, in time with the
rhythm of the horse’s hooves: “useless ... endless
... hopeless.” Ah! the only possible gesture,—Bernard
would never make it. Supposing
he did open his arms without asking her any
questions! If only she could lay her head on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
human breast, if only she could weep against a
living body!</p>

<p>She noticed the embankment on which Jean
Azévédo had sat, one hot day. To think she
had believed that some place existed in the world
in which she could have fulfilled her destiny
among beings who would have understood her,
perhaps admired and loved her! But loneliness
had eaten into her like a leper’s sores: “No one
can help me. No one can hurt me.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Here is Monsieur, and Mademoiselle Clara.”</p>

<p>Balion drew in the reins. Two shadows came
forward. So Bernard, though still very weak,
had come to meet <span class="lock">her—impatient</span> to know that
all was well. She half-rose from her seat, and
cried out before they met: “Case dismissed.”</p>

<p>Merely replying, “Of course!” Bernard
helped the aunt to climb into the carriage and
took the reins. Balion was to go back on foot.
Aunt Clara sat between husband and wife. They
had to shout to her that it was all settled (she
had, in fact, only the vaguest knowledge of the
tragedy). The deaf woman began one of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
usual interminable discourses; she said <em>They</em>
had always played the same game and that it
was the Dreyfus affair all over again. “If you
keep on throwing mud, some of it will always
stick. <em>They</em> were terribly powerful and the Republicans
were very wrong not to keep their eyes
open. As soon as these poisonous brutes are
given the least chance, they’re on you at
once....”</p>

<p>These fatuities relieved the pair from the
necessity of exchanging a single word.</p>

<p>Aunt Clara, breathing heavily, went upstairs
carrying a candle in her hand:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to bed? Thérèse must be
worn out. You will find a cup of bouillon and
some cold chicken in your room.”</p>

<p>But husband and wife remained standing in
the entrance-hall. The old lady saw Bernard
open the door of the drawing-room, stand aside
for Thérèse, and disappear after her. If she
had not been deaf, she would have done a little
eavesdropping ... but there was nothing to
fear from her, buried, as she was, alive. She put
out her candle, however, went downstairs again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
and looked through the keyhole. Bernard was
moving a lamp: his face was fully in the light,
and he looked both nervous and solemn. The
aunt saw the back of Thérèse seated; she had
thrown her toque and mantle on to an arm-chair:
her wet shoes were steaming in front of the fire.
For one instant she turned her head to her husband
and the old lady was glad to see she was
smiling.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Thérèse was smiling. In the brief interval of
space and time between the stable and the house,
walking at Bernard’s side, she suddenly saw, or
thought she saw, what she ought to do. The
mere proximity of the man had destroyed her
hope of explaining herself, or of giving him her
confidence. How we distort the creatures we
know best as soon as they are no longer there!
During the whole of this journey, she had unconsciously
been trying to create an image of a
Bernard capable of understanding her;—but at
the first glance he appeared to her just as he
really was, one who had never once in his life
put himself in another’s place; one who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
never made the effort to get outside himself to
see what his opponent was seeing. Indeed, would
Bernard even listen to her? He paced the long,
low, damp room, and the flooring, which was
rotting here and there, creaked beneath his steps.
He did not look at his <span class="lock">wife,—he</span> was bursting
with a speech he had long since prepared. And
Thérèse, too, knew what she was going to say.
The simplest solution is always the one we never
think of. She would say, ‘I am going to disappear,
Bernard. Don’t worry about me. I will
go out into the night at once, if you like. I
am not afraid of the forest or the darkness.
They know me: we know each other. I was
created in the image of this arid land in which
nothing lives except the birds that pass over it
and stray wild boars. I consent to my expulsion;
burn all my photographs; let even my daughter
no longer know my name, let me be in the eyes
of the family as if I had never been.’</p>

<p>And Thérèse opened her mouth, and said,
“Let me disappear, Bernard.”</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice Bernard turned. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
hurried back from the far end of the room, the
veins of his face swollen:</p>

<p>“What,” he stuttered, “do you dare to express
an opinion? Not another word! Your business
is to listen, to receive my orders and obey what
I shall decide once and for all.”</p>

<p>He stammered no more, having now got into
touch with his carefully prepared phrases. Leaning
against the mantelpiece, he spoke in measured
tones, taking a piece of paper from his pocket
and referring to it now and then. Thérèse was
no longer frightened; she wanted to laugh: he
was <span class="lock">ridiculous,—a</span> purely comic figure. She
cared little for what he was saying in that disgusting
accent of his that made every one laugh
except at Saint Clair. She would go. Why all
this melodrama? It would not have mattered
in the least if this fool had disappeared from
the ranks of living men. She noticed his ill-kept
nails against the paper that shook in his hands:
he had no cuffs on his shirt, he was one of those
absurd oafs who are out of their proper station,
and whose lives are of no value to anything or
anybody. It is only from habit that one attaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
infinite importance to a man’s existence.
Robespierre was right: and Napoleon, and Lenin....
He saw her smile: lost his temper, raised
his voice, and she was obliged to listen:</p>

<p>“I’ve got you; do you understand? You will
have to obey what the Family has decided, or
else....”</p>

<p>“Or else ... what?”</p>

<p>She no longer troubled to feign indifference:
she assumed a tone of bravado and mockery:
“Too late!” she cried. “You have given evidence
in my favour: you can’t go back on it. You will
be convicted of perjury....”</p>

<p>“Another piece of evidence can always be discovered.
I have such a further proof in my desk.
There is no statute of limitations for evidence,
thank God!”</p>

<p>She shuddered:</p>

<p>“What do you want of me?” she asked.</p>

<p>He consulted his notes, and for a few seconds
Thérèse sat listening to the stupendous silence
of Argelouse. The hour of cock-crow was yet
far off: no living water flowed in that desert, not
a breath of wind moved the countless tree-tops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“I am not giving way to any personal considerations.
I am disregarding myself: the Family
alone counts. The interests of the Family
have always dictated all my decisions. I have
consented for the honour of the Family, to cheat
the justice of my country. God will be my
judge.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This pompous tone made Thérèse feel ill.
She felt like asking him to express himself more
simply.</p>

<p>“It is of importance, for the sake of the
Family, that the world should think our relations
all they should be, and that I should not
seem to throw any doubt upon your innocence.
On the other hand, I want to protect myself as
far as possible....”</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of me, Bernard?”</p>

<p>“Afraid? No: I merely regard you with horror.
But,” he went on: “I shall waste no time;
what I am saying, I say once and for all: we shall
leave this place to-morrow and go and live near
by in the Desqueyroux house: I will not have your
aunt living with us. Your meals will be brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
to your room by Balionte. You are forbidden to
enter any other room: but I shall not prevent
you going for walks in the woods. On Sunday
we shall be present together at High Mass in
the Church of Saint Clair. You must be seen
walking with me: and on the first Thursday of
the month we shall go in an open carriage to the
fair at B——, and to visit your father, as we
have always done.”</p>

<p>“And Marie?”</p>

<p>“Marie leaves to-morrow with her nurse for
Saint Clair, and after that my mother will take
her to the South. We will invent some reason
of health. You can hardly have supposed she
would be left with you? We must put her in
safety, too! If I had gone, she would have had
the property when she was twenty-one. After
the husband, the child ... naturally!”</p>

<p>Thérèse had got up: she stifled a cry:</p>

<p>“So you think it was for the pines that I....”
So among the many secret springs of her action,
this imbecile had not been able to discover one;
and he invented the lowest....</p>

<p>“Why, of course: for the pines ... what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
else? I defy you to produce another motive....
However, it is of no importance and no
longer interests me; I ask myself no more questions.
You are nothing: all that exists is the
name you bear, alas! In a few months, when
every one is convinced of our good relations, and
Anne has married young Deguilhem, ... you
may be aware that the Deguilhems are insisting
on some little delay and asking for time to think
matters over ... then I shall at last be able
to go and live at Saint Clair: you will stay here.
You will be neurasthenic, or something....”</p>

<p>“Mad, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No, that would injure Marie. But we shall
find plenty of plausible reasons.... And that
is all.”</p>

<p>Thérèse murmured: “At Argelouse ...
until I die....”</p>

<p>She went to the window and opened it. At that
moment Bernard was really happy; this woman
who had always intimidated and humiliated
him, this evening he had her at his feet. How
abject she must feel! His moderation made him
feel quite pleased with himself. Madame de la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
Trave constantly told him he was a saint: the
whole Family praised his noble character: and
indeed he began for the first time to realise his
own nobility of mind. When, with many precautions,
Thérèse’s attempt on his life had been
disclosed to him in the nursing-home, his self-possession,
which had been so highly commended,
had cost him but little effort. Nothing seems
really serious to those who are incapable of love;
because he was without love, Bernard had only
felt the sort of tremulous joy that follows an
escape from great danger: the sort of sensation
a man might have who had been told that he has
lived for years, without knowing it, in the company
of a homicidal maniac. But that evening
Bernard was conscious of his strength: he dominated
life. He marvelled how every difficulty
gives way before a clear and upright mind: even
so soon after all this turmoil he was ready to
maintain that “no one is ever unhappy except
by his own fault.” See how he had dealt with
the most appalling tragedy as if it had been the
most ordinary matter of business. It would
hardly be known: he would save his face: no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
would sympathize with him any more, and he
hated sympathy. There is nothing humiliating
about having married a criminal when one has
the last word. Besides, a bachelor life is no
bad thing, and the proximity of death had marvellously
increased in him his taste for landed
property, shooting, motor-cars, and things to eat
and drink;—for life, in short.</p>

<p>Thérèse remained standing before the window:
she could catch a glimpse of white gravel,
and smell the chrysanthemums, which were protected
from the cattle by wire-netting. Beyond
them a dark mass of oaks hid the pines: but the
night was full of their resinous odour: like a
hostile army, invisible but near at hand, Thérèse
knew that they surrounded the house. These
warders, whose muttered lamentations she could
hear, would watch her wasting away through the
winters, and gasping through the summer heats:
they would be the witnesses of her slow strangulation.
She shut the window once more and went
up to Bernard.</p>

<p>“Do you think you will keep me here by
force?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“As you like ... but let me tell you this:
you won’t leave this house except in handcuffs.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense! I know you: don’t make
yourself out worse than you are. You will not
expose the Family to such shame. You need not
try to frighten me.” Whereupon, with the air
of a man who has well weighed everything, he
explained to her that to leave the house was to
confess her guilt. In that case, the Family
could only avert disgrace by amputating the diseased
member, rejecting and disowning it in the
face of the world.</p>

<p>“That was, in fact, the decision my mother
wanted us to make, I may tell you. We were on
the point of letting justice take its course; and
if it had not been for Anne and Marie....
But there is still time. Do not give your answer
in a hurry: I will give you till to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I have my father still,” said Thérèse in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Your father? But we’re in entire agreement.
He has his career, his politics, the ideas he stands
for: his only thought is to hush up the scandal at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
whatever cost. You must realise what he has
done for you: it was entirely due to him that the
enquiry came to nothing. Besides, he must have
made his express wishes known to you....
Hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>Bernard’s voice was no longer raised, he became
almost courteous. It was not that he felt
the slightest compassion. But this woman, whom
he could not even hear breathing, was at last
prostrate: she had found her true place. All was
now in order. Another man’s peace of mind
would not have survived such a blow: Bernard
was proud to have made so successful a recovery:
any one may be deceived; indeed everybody, for
the matter of that, had been deceived by Thérèse,
even Madame de la Trave, who was usually such
a penetrating judge of character. The fact was
that in these days people do not take sufficient
account of principles: they no longer realise the
dangers of an education, such as Thérèse had received;
a perverted creature, no doubt; still, it
is no use saying,—“if she had believed in God”
... fear is the beginning of wisdom.</p>

<p>Such were Bernard’s thoughts. And he reflected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
too, that all the neighbours, greedy to
enjoy their shame, would be greatly disconcerted
every Sunday by the sight of so harmonious a
household! He was almost impatient for Sunday
to come so that he might observe their expressions!...
Moreover, justice would still be
done. He took the lamp, and as he raised it, the
light fell upon Thérèse’s averted head:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going up yet?”</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him: and he went
out, leaving her in darkness. At the bottom of
the staircase Aunt Clara sat crouching on the lowest
step. As the old woman stared at him, he
smiled with an effort, and took her arm to raise
her. But she <span class="lock">resisted,—like</span> an old dog against
the bed of its dying master. Bernard placed the
lamp on the paved floor, and shouted in the old
woman’s ear that Thérèse was already feeling
much better, but that she wanted to be alone for
a few minutes before she went to bed.</p>

<p>“It is just one of her moods, you know.”</p>

<p>Yes, the aunt knew: it was always her ill-luck
to go into Thérèse’s room just at the moment
when she wanted to be alone. Indeed, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
past, the old lady had often felt she was not
wanted immediately she had opened the door.
She got up with an effort and, leaning on Bernard’s
arm, went up to her room, which was over
the large drawing-room. Bernard went in after
her, carefully lit a candle on the table, kissed
her on the forehead, and then withdrew. The
aunt never took her eyes off him. What did she
read on the faces of men whose voices she could
not hear? She left Bernard the time to get to
his room, and opened her door again gently ...
but he was still on the landing, leaning against
the banisters, rolling a cigarette; she hurriedly
went in again, her legs trembling and so breathless
that she had not the strength to undress.
She remained lying on her bed, with staring eyes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the drawing-room, Thérèse was sitting in
the dark. There were still some embers alive
under the ashes of the fire. She did not move.
Now that it was too late, stray passages from the
confession she had prepared during her journey,
floated to the surface of her mind; but she could
not find fault with herself for not having used
it. As a matter of fact, the story was too well
constructed, and had but little reference to
reality. The importance she had chosen to attach
to young Azévédo’s conversation was mere foolishness.
As if that could have had the slightest
effect! No, she had obeyed some inner inexorable
law: she had failed to destroy this family,
so she herself would be destroyed; they were
right to consider her a monster, but she thought
them monstrous, too. Without appearing to do
so they now intended gradually and methodically
to crush her out of existence. Henceforth, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
powerful family machine would be used against
her,—because she had not understood how to
dislocate the mechanism, nor get out of reach of
its ruthless wheels. It was useless to look for
any reason other than the fact that they were
what they were, and she was herself. “All those
efforts,” she thought, “to wear a mask and a disguise,
and impersonate a wife, which I could
only keep up for less than two years, I imagine
other women, no different from me, carry on until
they die, saved, perhaps, by use and wont,
drugged by habit, and stupefied into slumber
against the maternal and all-powerful bosom of
the Family. But I ... I ... I....”</p>

<p>She got up, opened the window, and felt the
chill of dawn. Why not escape? She had only
to get out of the window. Would they pursue
her? Would they again deliver her up to justice?
It was a risk worth taking. Anything was
better than the interminable agony. Thérèse
had already drawn up a chair against the window.
But she had no money; thousands of pines
were hers, but they were useless: she could not
touch a penny except through Bernard. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
could do nothing but take to the moors, as
Daguerre had done, that hunted murderer for
whom Thérèse as a child had felt so much pity.
(She remembered the gendarmes whom Balionte
had entertained in the kitchen at Argelouse)—and
it was the Desqueyroux dog who had got
on the poor wretch’s track. He had been picked
up half-dead with hunger in the heather; and
Thérèse had seen him lying bound in a haycart.
He was said to have died on the ship before he
reached Cayenne. A ship ... a convict settlement....
They were quite capable of giving
her up, as they had said. That evidence that
Bernard pretended he <span class="lock">had,—it</span> was a lie, no
doubt; unless he had discovered that package of
poisons in the pocket of the old cloak.</p>

<p>Thérèse decided to make certain. She felt her
way to the staircase: as she went up it she saw
more clearly, the light of dawn was shining
through the windows above her. There, on the
attic landing, was the cupboard where the old
clothes were <span class="lock">hanging,—the</span> ones that never appeared,
because they were only used during the
shooting season. There was a deep pocket in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
that faded mantle: Aunt Clara used to put her
knitting in it in the times when she also used to
go out and watch for the pigeons to come over.
Thérèse slipped her hand into it and drew out
the packet sealed with wax:</p>


<ul><li>Chloroform: 10 grammes.</li>
<li>Aconitine: 2 grammes.</li>
<li>Digitaline: 20 centigrammes.</li>
</ul>

<p>She read the words and figures over again.
Death: she had always had a terror of death.
The essential thing was not to contemplate <span class="lock">death,—only</span>
to think of the necessary preliminaries:
pour out the water, dissolve the powder, drink it
off, lie down on a bed, and close her eyes: she
must not look further than that. Why be more
afraid of the sleep that was death, than of any
other sleep? If she was shivering, it was only because
the early morning air was chilly. She went
downstairs again, and stopped at the door of the
room in which Marie slept. The nurse’s snores
were like the grunts of an animal. Thérèse
pushed the door back: the growing daylight
filtered through the shutters, and the narrow iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
bed gleamed white in the darkness. Two tiny
fists were lying on the sheet: a baby profile was
buried in the pillow. Thérèse recognised that
ear; it was a little too <span class="lock">large,—just</span> like her own.
They were right, a replica of herself lay there,
sunk in slumber. “I shall go <span class="lock">away,—but</span> that
part of me remains; a fate that must be fulfilled
to the end, and not one iota omitted.” All manner
of dumb desires and blind inclinations, laws
of the blood that none may <span class="lock">escape,—in</span> these she
must survive. Thérèse had read of desperate
people carrying off their children to death with
them: worthy citizens let their paper fall, exclaiming
“How can such things be possible?” Because
she was a criminal, Thérèse knew too well
that they were possible, and that for very little....
She knelt down, and laid her lips against
a little outstretched hand; she was amazed at
something that surged up from her inmost being,
rose up to her eyes, and burned her cheeks:
a few poor <span class="lock">tears,—she</span> who never wept!</p>

<p>Thérèse got up, looked at the child once more,
then went into her own room, filled a glass with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
water, broke the wax seal, and hesitated between
the three packets of poison.</p>

<p>The window was open. The crowing of the
cocks seemed to cleave the mist, which still clung
to the pines in transparent strips. The land lay
bathed in the dawn. How could she say farewell
to so much light? What was death? No
one knew what it was. Thérèse was not quite
certain that it meant annihilation: she was not
sure that there was no one there. She loathed
herself for feeling such terrors; she who did
not hesitate to hurl a fellow-creature into nothingness,
was scared of it herself. How her
cowardice humiliated her! If that Being existed
(and in one brief instant she saw before her that
dreadful Corpus Christi procession, that solitary
figure weighed down under his golden cape, the
thing that he carried in both hands, and his look
of dejection); since He exists, let Him turn aside
the murderous hand before it is too late; and if
it is His will that a poor blind soul should pass
that bourne, let Him give a loving welcome to
the criminal whom He created.</p>

<p>Thérèse poured the chloroform into the water:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
its name was more familiar to her and made her
feel less frightened because it called up images
of sleep. She must be quick: the house was
awakening: Balionte had taken down the shutters
in Aunt Clara’s room. What was she shouting
to the deaf woman? The servant usually
knew how to make herself understood by a
movement of the lips. A noise of doors and
hurried steps; Thérèse had only just the time
to throw a shawl over the table to hide the
poisons. Balionte came in without knocking.</p>

<p>“Ma’m’iselle is dead! I found her dead, on
her bed with all her clothes on. She is cold already.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In spite of everything, a rosary was placed
between the fingers of the old unbeliever, a
crucifix on her breast. Tenants came in, knelt
down, and went out, not without long looks at
Thérèse who was standing at the head of the
bed: (“And who knows if it wasn’t she who
did it?”) Bernard had gone to Saint Clair to
tell the Family and to make the necessary arrangements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
He must have thought that this
accident came at an opportune moment and would
distract people’s attention. Thérèse looked at
the body, the old faithful body that came and lay
down in her path at the very moment she was
going to hurl herself to death. Chance: coincidence?
If any one talked about free-will, she
used to shrug her shoulders. People said to each
other: “Did you see? She didn’t even pretend
to cry.” Thérèse was speaking silently to her
who was no longer there: she must live, but like
a corpse in the hands of those who hate her.
She must try and look no further.</p>

<p>At the funeral Thérèse took her proper place.
On the following Sunday, she entered the church
with Bernard who instead of going down the
aisle, as his custom was, ostentatiously walked
up the nave. Thérèse did not raise her crêpe veil
until she had reached her place between her
mother-in-law and her husband. She was hidden
from the congregation by a pillar: opposite her
was only the choir. She was hemmed in on every
side: the mass of the congregation behind her,
Bernard on the right, Madame de la Trave on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the left, only the choir lay before her, as the
arena stretches away in front of the bull when
he emerges from the darkness: that empty space
where between two children stood a man, disguised
and muttering, with parted hands.</p>

<h2 class="no-break" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER <abbr title="Eleven">XI</abbr></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening Bernard and Thérèse came
back to Argelouse to the Desqueyroux house,
which had hardly been inhabited for years. The
chimneys smoked, the windows did not fasten
properly, and the draughts blew under the
doors where the rats had gnawed them. But
the autumn was so lovely that year, that Thérèse
did not at first suffer from these inconveniences.
Bernard was out shooting until the evening: no
sooner had he come back, than he settled down
in the kitchen and took his dinner with the Balions:
Thérèse could hear the clatter of forks and
the monotonous sound of voices. Night falls
quickly in October. She had read the few
books she had brought with her over and over
again, and she was tired of them. Bernard did
not reply to her request that he would send on
an order to his bookseller at Bordeaux: he only
allowed Thérèse to renew her supply of cigarettes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
She sat and stirred the fire ... but the
thick resinous smoke made her eyes smart and
irritated her throat, which had already been injured
by tobacco. No sooner had Balionte fetched
away the remains of a hurried meal, than Thérèse
put out the lamp and went to bed. How many
hours she lay there before sleep came to her deliverance!
The silence of Argelouse prevented
her sleeping: she preferred the windy <span class="lock">nights,—the</span>
confused murmur of the pines is full of
human kindness. It soothed the turmoil of her
mind. The wild nights of the equinox sent her
to sleep better than the nights when all was still.</p>

<p>However interminable the evenings seemed,
she sometimes came back to the house before
dusk had <span class="lock">fallen,—either</span> because, at the sight of
her, a mother had seized her child by the hand
and dragged it roughly back into the <span class="lock">farmyard,—or</span>
because some herdsman, whose name she
knew, had not answered her greeting. Oh, how
good it would be to lose herself, to drown herself
in the deepest depths of some populous city!
At Argelouse, there was not a shepherd that did
not know her story (even Aunt Clara’s death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
was laid to her charge). There was not a threshold
that she would have dared to cross: she
went out by a back door, and avoided houses;
the distant rumble of a cart was enough to make
her hurry down a side road. She walked quickly,
with the beating heart of a driven bird; and she
lay down in the heather to wait until a bicycle had
passed.</p>

<p>On Sunday, at Mass at Saint Clair, she did not
feel this terror, and was conscious of a respite.
Public opinion in the town seemed more favourable.
She did not know that her father and the
La Traves had depicted her as an innocent victim
wounded to death. “We are afraid that the
poor girl will never get over it: she refuses to
see any one and the doctor says that she must not
be opposed. Bernard is constantly with her,
but her mind is affected....”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the last night of October a violent wind
from the Atlantic raved among the pines for
many hours, and Thérèse lay between sleeping
and waking listening to its ocean roar. But at
daylight she was awakened by quite another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
sound of lamentation. She pushed open the
shutters and the room was still dark: a dense
steady rain streamed down on to the roofs of
the out-buildings and the leaves of the oak trees,
which had hardly yet begun to fall. Bernard
did not go out that day. Thérèse sat smoking;
she threw away her cigarette, went out onto the
landing, and heard her husband wandering from
one room to another on the ground floor: a smell
of pipe-smoke reached her room, overpowered
that of Thérèse’s light tobacco, and she recognised
the smell of her old life. The first day
of bad weather.... How many would she
have to live through, sitting at the corner of that
fire-place by the dying embers? In the corners
of the room the paper was peeling off the damp
walls, on which could still be seen the marks of
the old pictures which Bernard had taken away
to adorn the drawing-room at Saint <span class="lock">Clair,—and</span>
the desolate rusty nails. On the mantelpiece, in
frames with a triple border of tortoiseshell,
stood photographs as pallid as if the dead they
represented had died a second death. Bernard’s
father, her grandmother, Bernard himself as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
boy, with bobbed hair. There was still the whole
day before her which she must spend in that
melancholy room; and weeks, and months to
follow.</p>

<p>As it began to grow dark, Thérèse could bear
it no longer; she opened the door quietly, went
downstairs and into the kitchen. There she saw
Bernard sitting on a low chair before the fire.
He got up suddenly; Balion stopped cleaning
a gun; Balionte dropped her knitting. All three
of them looked at her with such an expression
that she asked:</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of me?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know you were forbidden to
enter the kitchen?” She did not reply and turned
towards the door. Bernard called her back.</p>

<p>“However, as you have come, I should like to
tell you that my presence here is no longer necessary.
We have been able to work up a good
deal of sympathy at Saint Clair; people think
you, or pretend to think you, rather neurasthenic.
It is understood that you prefer to live alone and
that I often come to see you. After this you
need not come to Mass.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>She stammered out that she did not mind
coming; to which he replied that her likes and
dislikes were not in question. The desired result
had been obtained:</p>

<p>“And since the Mass means nothing to
you....”</p>

<p>She opened her mouth, seemed about to speak,
but said nothing. He would not give way, lest
a word or a gesture of hers might compromise a
success so quick and so unexpected. She asked
how Marie was. He said she was very well,
and that she was leaving to-morrow for Beaulieu
with Anne and Madame de la Trave. He was
going to spend a few weeks there himself; two
months at the most. He opened the door and
stood aside for Thérèse to pass.</p>

<p>In the dark dawn she heard Balion harnessing
the horses; then Bernard’s voice, the trampling
of hooves, and the rattle of the departing carriage.
And then the <span class="lock">rain,—on</span> the roofs, on the
clouded window-panes, on the desolate fields, on
fifty miles of moor and marsh, on the shifting
sanddunes by the sea shore, and on the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>Thérèse lit a cigarette from the one she had
just finished. About four o’clock she put on a
mackintosh and went out into the rain. But the
darkness frightened her and she came back to
her room. The fire was out, and as she was
shivering, she went to bed. About seven o’clock
Balionte brought her up an egg, fried, on a
slice of ham, but she would not eat it; the taste
of fat had begun to make her feel sick! Never
anything but potted meat or ham. Balionte said
that she had nothing better to give her: Monsieur
Bernard had forbidden her to have game. She
complained that Thérèse made her go up and
down stairs for nothing (she had something the
matter with her heart and her legs were swollen).
The work was really too much for her; she only
did it for Monsieur Bernard’s sake.</p>

<p>Thérèse was feverish that night, and in her
abnormally clear imagination she evolved a complete
existence in Paris: she saw once more the
restaurant in the Bois where she had been; this
time she was not with Bernard, but with Jean
Azévédo and some young women. She put down
her tortoiseshell cigarette case on the table, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
talked frankly and freely, to the faint accompaniment
of an orchestra. She could see the circle of
admiring faces, listening eagerly but without
astonishment. One woman said: “That is so
like me.... I have felt that, too.” A literary
man took her aside, and said: “You ought to write
down everything that comes into your head; we
will publish it in our review and call it ‘The
Diary of a Woman of To-day.’”</p>

<p>A young man who was desperately in love with
her, took her home in his car. They were driving
back along the Avenue du Bois; she felt no emotion
whatever, but she took a certain pleasure in
the agonised young body close beside her. “No,
not this evening,” she said to him. “I’m dining
with a friend this evening.” “What about to-morrow
evening?” “I can’t to-morrow either.”
“Are your evenings never free?” “Hardly ever
... I might almost say never.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was one being in her life who made the
rest of the world seem insignificant; some one
unknown to any one in her circle; very humble
and obscure; but Thérèse’s whole existence revolved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
round this sun whom she alone could see,
and whose warmth reached no other flesh but
hers. The murmur of Paris was like the wind
in the pines. This body that lay so close to hers,
light as it was, prevented her breathing; but she
would sooner stifle than send him away. (And
Thérèse made the gesture of an <span class="lock">embrace—she</span>
clasped her left shoulder with her right hand
and drove the nails of her left hand into her right
shoulder.)</p>

<p>She got up, crossed the room barefooted, and
opened the window; the night outside was not
cold; but she could hardly bring herself to
imagine that a day must come when it would
rain no more. If she had had any money she
would have escaped to Paris, gone straight to
Jean Azévédo and confided in him; he would
know how to get her work. If she could only be
a woman alone in Paris, earning her living and
dependent on no one...! Oh to be without
a family! She would choose <em>her own people</em> as
she <span class="lock">pleased,—the</span> tie should not be one of blood,
but of the mind, and even of the flesh as well;
she would discover her true relations, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
few and scattered they might be.... She went
to sleep at last, with the window open. The
cold damp dawn awoke her; her teeth chattered,
and she could not bring herself to get up and shut
the <span class="lock">window,—she</span> could not even put out her
arms and draw up the bedclothes.</p>

<p>That day she did not get up or even do her
hair. She swallowed a few mouthfuls of potted
meat and drank some coffee so as to be able to
smoke,—tobacco on an empty stomach did not
agree with her. She tried to recapture her
imaginings of the night; and, indeed, at Argelouse
the day was almost as quiet and as dark
as the night. In these days, the shortest in the
year, time disappears under the pall of rain, and
one hour melts into the next; dusk passes into
dusk in unalterable silence. But Thérèse had no
desire for sleep, and her dreams became more
and more vivid; she searched her past methodically
for forgotten faces, lips that she had loved
from afar, vague forms that casual encounters,
or the chances of the night, had brought into
contact with her young body. She moulded an
image of happiness, invented an imaginary joy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
and used all the fragments of her experience to
build up an impossible love.</p>

<p>“She never gets up now, and she leaves her
potted meat and her bread,” said Balionte to
Balion some time after this: “but she finishes
the bottle fast enough. She’d drink as much as
you’d let her have, she would. And then she
burns the sheets with her cigarettes. She’ll end
by setting the house on fire. She smokes so
much that her fingers and nails are all yellow,
just as if she’d dipped them in arnica. It’s a
shame, so it is!—those sheets were woven at
home.... She won’t get clean ones very often,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>She added that she was perfectly willing to
sweep the room or to make the bed: it was the
creature’s fault for pretending to be ill and not
getting up. It was not worth Balionte’s trouble,
with her swollen legs and all, to carry up jugs of
hot water; she found them in the evening standing
at the bedroom door where she had put them
in the morning.</p>

<p>Thérèse’s thoughts began to be less absorbed
in the unknown being that she had evoked for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
her delight; she grew weary of her happiness,
and sated with imaginary pleasure, so she conceived
another way of escape.</p>

<p>All manner of people knelt about her humble
bed; a child of Argelouse, one of those who ran
away when she came near, was brought dying
into Thérèse’s room; she laid her nicotine-stained
fingers on him, and he got up cured.</p>

<p>She had other and less exalted dreams. She
planned a house by the seaside, saw in her mind’s
eye the garden, and the terrace, arranged the
rooms, chose each piece of furniture one by one,
tried to make up her mind where she would put
what she had brought from Saint Clair, and
argued with herself over the choice of materials.
Then the scene would fade, the outlines grew
confused, and nothing was left but an arbour
and a bench beside the sea. And there Thérèse
was sitting, her head against the shoulder of one
who sat beside her; she got up, as the bell rang
for dinner, and went into the darkened arbour
with some one walking at her side who suddenly
flung his arms about her and drew her to him.
A kiss, she thought, must bring time to a standstill;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
she imagined that in love there must be
seconds that last for ever. So she imagined;
but she would never know. Once more she sees
the white house and the well; she hears the
harsh voice of the pump; the courtyard is full
of the fragrance of heliotrope; dinner will be a
rest before the joys of the evening and the night,
which she dares not conceive, for they pass so
far beyond the powers of the human heart.
Thus, the love of which Thérèse, of all women,
had been utterly frustrated, possessed and pervaded
all her being. She could hardly hear
Balionte’s hoarse cries. The old creature was
trying to convey to her that Monsieur Bernard
would come back from the South one day or
another without letting them know. And what
would he say when he saw that room? It was
little better than a pig-sty! Madame must get
up whether she liked it or not.</p>

<p>As she sat on the bed, Thérèse stared with
amazement at her skeleton-like legs, and her
feet looked enormous. Balionte wrapped her in
a dressing-gown and pushed her into an arm-chair.
She reached out for the cigarettes, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
her hand dropped nerveless at her side. A cold
sunlight came through the open window. Balionte
bustled about with a broom in her hand,
breathing heavily and grumbling to herself,—Balionte
who must have had a good heart, because
it was always said that every Christmas the
death of the pig which she had been fattening
made her cry. She could not bear Thérèse not
to answer her: in her eyes silence was an insult,
a mark of contempt. But Thérèse was no longer
mistress of her speech. When she felt against
her body the coolness of the clean sheets, she
thought she had said, “Thank you,” though as
a matter of fact she had not uttered a word.
“You won’t burn these, I think,” said Balionte
to her sharply as she left the room. Thérèse was
afraid that she had taken away the cigarettes and
put out her hand towards the table: they were
gone. How could she live without smoking?
She could not exist without the constant touch
of these small, dry, warm objects against her
fingers. She must have their odour always in
her nostrils, and fill the room with the fragrant
mist that she had inhaled and ejected from her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
lips. Balionte would not come back until the
evening; a whole afternoon without tobacco!
She closed her eyes and her yellow fingers moved
mechanically as though they held a cigarette.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock Balionte came in with a candle,
and put the tray on the table: milk, coffee, and
a piece of bread. “So you don’t want anything
else?” And she waited maliciously for Thérèse
to ask for her cigarettes; but Thérèse’s face was
turned steadfastly to the wall and she did not
move.</p>

<p>Doubtless Balionte had neglected to shut the
window properly: a gust of wind blew it open,
and the cold night air filled the room. Thérèse
could not rouse herself to throw off the bedclothes,
get up, and run barefooted to the window.
She lay, motionless, huddled up, the sheets
drawn up to her eyes, and the icy breath only
touched her forehead and her eyelids. Argelouse
was full of the vast murmur of the pines,
their noise was like the noise of the ocean, but it
did not seem to break the silence of that place.
Thérèse reflected that if she meant to make a
friend of pain, she should not have buried herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
beneath the bedclothes. She tried to push
them back a little, but could not bear the cold
for more than a few seconds. She tried again,
and endured a little <span class="lock">longer,—and</span> so on, as if it
had been a game. Thus, though it was not
deliberate, physical pain became her occupation
and—who knows?—her reason for existing in
the world.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A letter</span> from the master.”</p>

<p>As Thérèse did not take the envelope that she
held out, Balionte pressed it on her: Monsieur
had surely said when he was coming back, and
she must know, so as to have everything in
readiness.</p>

<p>“If Madame would like me to read it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, read it, read it,” said Thérèse. And, as
she always did when Balionte was in the room,
turned her face to the wall. However, what
Balionte managed to decipher, aroused her from
her lethargy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>I have been glad to hear from Balion’s reports

<p>Bernard announced that he was coming back
by road, but that as he expected to stop at several
places on the way he could not fix the exact date
of his return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<cite>It will certainly not be later than December
20th. Do not be surprised to see me return with
Anne and young Deguilhem. They became engaged
at Beaulieu, but it is not yet official; young
Deguilhem is anxious to see you first. A mere
question of formality, so he assures me; for my
part, I have a feeling that he wants to form an
opinion on you know what. I am sure you are
intelligent enough to pass the test. Remember
that you are ill, and that your mind is affected.
Anyhow, I rely on you. Try not to damage
Anne’s happiness, or compromise the happy issue
of a project so satisfactory for the Family in
every respect; you will not lose by it: if you fail
me I should not hesitate to make you pay dearly
for any attempt to wreck the scheme; but I am
sure I have nothing to fear on that score.</cite>”</p>
</div>

<p>It was a beautiful day, clear and cold. Thérèse
got up, obedient to Balionte’s injunctions, and
took a turn in the garden leaning on her arm,
but she found it very difficult to finish a scrap of
chicken for her dinner. There were ten days
left before December 20th. If Madame would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
consent to make an effort, it was quite long
enough to get on her legs again.</p>

<p>“One can’t say that she doesn’t try,” said
Balionte to Balion. “She does what she can.
Monsieur Bernard knows how to break in a dog
that won’t obey him. You know that iron collar
he puts on them? Well, it didn’t take him long
to make her crawl. But he’d better not be too
sure of her....”</p>

<p>Thérèse was, in fact, making a great effort
to try to give up dreaming and sleeping, and
come back to life again. She forced herself
to walk and eat, but especially to get her brain
clear once more, and to look at men and things
with the eyes of the flesh;—and just as though
she were coming back to a stretch of heath which
she had set on fire, treading upon the ashes and
walking among the burnt and blackened pines,
so she would try to speak and smile among that
Family,—her family.</p>

<p>On the eighteenth, about three o’clock, on a
cloudy but fine afternoon, Thérèse was sitting in
her room in front of the fire, her head leaning
against the back of the chair, and her eyes shut.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
She was awakened by the throbbing engines of
a motor-car; she recognised Bernard’s voice in
the entrance-hall and also Madame de la Trave’s.
When Balionte, completely out of breath, had
pushed open the door without knocking, Thérèse
was already standing up before the mirror. She
was putting rouge on her cheeks and lips. “I
must not frighten the poor young man,” she said
to herself.</p>

<p>But Bernard had made a mistake in not going
up to see his wife at once. Young Deguilhem,
who had promised his family “to keep his eyes
extremely wide open,” reflected that this was,
“to say the least of it, a rather significant piece
of neglect.” He drew a little aside from Anne
and turned up his fur collar, remarking that “it
was not worth trying to warm these country
drawing-rooms.” “Have you no cellar below?”
he asked Bernard. “If not, your floor will always
rot unless you lay down a bed of cement....”</p>

<p>Anne de la Trave was wearing a grey squirrel
cloak, and a felt hat without any ribbon or bow.
(“But,” as Madame de la Trave said, “it cost
more just as it was, than our hats did with all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
their feathers and aigrettes. It is the best felt,
certainly: it comes from Lailhaca, but it is a
Reboux model.”) Madame de la Trave stretched
out her boots to the fire, and her face, at once
arrogant and weak, was turned towards the door.
She had promised Bernard she would be equal
to the situation, but she had warned him that
she would not kiss Thérèse. “You cannot ask
your mother to do that, it will be dreadful
enough for me to have to touch her hand. My
feeling is this: what she did was awful enough,
God knows; but it isn’t that that revolts me the
most. One already knew that there were people
capable of committing murder ... but it’s her
hypocrisy! That really is awful! Don’t you
remember what she said: ‘Mother, do take this
chair, you will be more comfortable....’ And
don’t you remember when she was so frightened
of giving you a shock? ‘The poor darling has
such a horror of death, a consultation would be
the end of him....’ God knows I didn’t suspect
anything; but ‘poor darling,’ coming from
her, did surprise me....”</p>

<p>At present, in that Argelouse drawing-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Madame de la Trave was only conscious of the
embarrassment that every one was feeling; and
she noticed young Deguilhem’s goggle eyes fixed
on Bernard.</p>

<p>“Bernard, you ought to go and see what
Thérèse is doing ... perhaps she is feeling
worse.”</p>

<p>Anne, who seemed indifferent and aloof from
anything that might happen, was the first to
recognise a familiar step, and said: “I hear her
coming down.” Bernard, with a hand against his
heart, was seized with a palpitation; he was a
fool not to have come the day before; he ought
to have arranged the scene with Thérèse in advance.
What would she say? She was quite
capable of upsetting everything without precisely
doing anything that she could be called to account
for. How slowly she came downstairs!
They were all standing up, turned towards the
door, which Thérèse at last opened.</p>

<p>Bernard was to remember, for many years
after, that at the approach of that wasted form,
that small, white, painted face, his first thought
was: <i>The Assize Court</i>. But not because of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Thérèse’s crime. In a flash, he saw before him
that coloured picture from the <cite>Petit Parisien</cite>,
which among so many others adorned the wooden
closets in the garden at Argelouse; while amid
the buzz of flies, and the shrill voices of the
grasshoppers on a blazing day of summer, his
boyish eyes stared so earnestly at that red and
green drawing which depicted a poor wretched
girl who had been imprisoned and starved by her
parents at Poitiers.</p>

<p>So now, he watched Thérèse as she stood there,
bloodless and emaciated, and realised his folly
in not having got rid of this terrible <span class="lock">woman,—as</span>
one flings into the water an infernal machine
which may burst at any moment. Whether consciously
or not, Thérèse suggested <span class="lock">tragedy,—worse</span>
than that in fact: the tragedies of the Sunday
Newspapers. She could be nothing but
criminal or victim....</p>

<p>The Family broke into a murmur of astonishment
and pity, so obviously genuine, that young
Deguilhem began to doubt his conclusions and
did not know what to think.</p>

<p>“It is quite simple,” said Thérèse. “The bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
weather stopped my going out, so I lost my appetite.
I was hardly eating at all. It’s much better
to get thin than fat.... But I want to talk
about you, Anne, I am so delighted....”</p>

<p>She took Anne’s hands (she was sitting down
and Anne was standing) and looked at her. In
that face, which looked so ravaged, Anne could
clearly recognise the expression whose persistence
used to irritate her in days gone by. She remembered
how she used to say. “When you have
finished looking at me like that!”</p>

<p>“I am delighted to hear of your happiness,
my little Anne.”</p>

<p>As she uttered the word “happiness” she
smiled faintly at young <span class="lock">Deguilhem,—his</span> bald
head, his curly moustache, his sloping shoulders,
his tight little coat, and his fat little legs under
the black-and-grey striped trousers. (Oh well!
A man like any <span class="lock">other,—just</span> a husband!) Then
once more she rested her eyes on Anne and
said:</p>

<p>“Take your hat off.... Ah, now I recognise
you, darling.”</p>

<p>Anne now saw quite close to her those slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
twisted lips, those eyes that were always dry,
those eyes that could not weep; but she did not
know what Thérèse was thinking. Young
Deguilhem was saying that winter in the country
was not so dreadful for a woman who is fond of
her home:</p>

<p>“There are always so many things to do in a
house.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t ask for any news of Marie.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.... Tell me about Marie....”</p>

<p>Anne seemed once more distrustful and hostile;
she had been saying for months, in the same tone
as her mother: “I would have forgiven her anything,
because, after all, she is ill; but I cannot
forgive her indifference about Marie. When a
mother takes no interest in her child, you can
invent any excuses you like for her, I think it is
disgraceful.”</p>

<p>Thérèse read the young girl’s thoughts: “She
despises me because I did not begin by talking
about Marie. How can I explain? She would
not understand that I can think of nothing but
myself, that I am my only interest. Anne, of
course, is simply waiting to have children so as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
to efface herself in them as her mother does,
and all the women of the Family. But I want
to find myself again; I am trying to make my
own acquaintance.... Anne will forget our
youth together, the caresses of Jean Azévédo,
with the first howl of the brat which that little
object will beget upon her without even troubling
to take off his coat. The ambition of the women
of the Family is to lose all their individual existence.
This complete self-sacrifice for the
species is a fine thing; I feel the beauty of that
absorption, that self-annihilation ... but I—No!...”</p>

<p>She tried not to listen to what people were
saying, and to think of Marie: the child must
be able to talk now: “Perhaps it would amuse
me for a few minutes to listen to her, but I
should soon get tired of it, and want to be alone
with myself again.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Marie talks by now?” she asked
Anne.</p>

<p>“She repeats anything you like. It’s great
fun; whenever she hears a cock crow, or the
noise of a motor-horn, she puts up her little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
finger and says: Do you hear the music?’ She’s
a perfect little love.”</p>

<p>Thérèse thought to herself; “I must try to
listen to what they are saying: my head feels
quite empty; what is young Deguilhem talking
about?” She made a great effort and tried to
attend.</p>

<p>“My men at Balisac don’t work like they do
here: only four barrels of stuff, while the
Argelouse men get in seven or eight.”</p>

<p>“Well, with resin at its present price, they
really must be lazy.”</p>

<p>“Do you know that these people can earn a
hundred francs a day sometimes? ... but I
think we are tiring Madame Desqueyroux.”</p>

<p>Thérèse was resting her head against the back
of her chair. Everybody got up. Bernard decided
that he would not go back to Saint Clair.
Young Deguilhem agreed to drive the car which
the chauffeur would bring back to Argelouse the
following day with Bernard’s luggage. Thérèse
made an effort to get up but her mother-in-law
prevented her.</p>

<p>She shut her eyes, and heard Bernard say to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Madame de la Trave: “Really, that Balion pair
are beyond everything! I’ll let them have
something they won’t forget.” “Take care,
don’t do anything in a hurry; we don’t want
them to go away, they know a little too much:
and then don’t forget the estates: Balion’s the
only person who really knows the boundaries.”</p>

<p>And Madame de la Trave added in reply to
some remark of Bernard’s that Thérèse did not
hear:</p>

<p>“All the same, be careful, don’t trust her too
far; watch her movements, and never let her
go into the kitchen or dining-room alone....
No, she hasn’t fainted: she’s asleep, or pretending
to be....”</p>

<p>Thérèse opened her eyes again: Bernard stood
in front of her; he held a glass and said: “There,
drink that: it’s a glass of port, it will do you
good.” And as he always did what he had made
up his mind to do he went into the kitchen, and
proceeded to lose his temper. Thérèse heard
Balionte’s raucous <i lang="fr">patois</i> and thought: “Bernard
has clearly been frightened: I wonder why?” At
that moment he came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“I think you would eat with more appetite in
the dining-room than in your own room. I have
given orders for your place to be laid there
again.”</p>

<p>This was the Bernard she had known at the
time of the enquiry: the ally who wanted to save
her at any price. And now he was unreservedly
anxious she should get well. Yes, it was clear
he had been frightened. Thérèse watched him,
sitting opposite her, and stirring the fire, but she
could not guess what those great round eyes of
his were seeing in the flames:—the red and green
drawing from the <cite>Petit Parisien</cite>.</p>

<p>Incessant as the rain had been, not a single
puddle was left in the sand of Argelouse. In
the very depths of winter, after an hour’s sunshine,
one could walk dry-shod in country sandals,
along the road, on that dry and yielding
carpet of pine-needles. Bernard was out shooting
all day, but came back to meals: he was anxious
about Thérèse, and more attentive than he had
ever been. There was but little constraint in
their relations. He made her weigh herself every
three days, and not smoke more than two cigarettes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
after each meal. On Bernard’s advice
Thérèse took long walks: “Exercise is the best
digestive,” he would say.</p>

<p>She was no longer afraid of Argelouse: it
seemed as though the pines were moving further
off, opening their ranks, and signalling to her to
make her escape.</p>

<p>One evening Bernard had said to her: “I am
only asking you to wait until Anne’s marriage:
we must be seen in company once more by the
whole neighbourhood: after that you will be
free.” She had not been able to sleep during
the following night: her joy made her restless
and her eyes would not close. At dawn she heard
the innumerable cocks, who did not seem to be
answering each other: they were all crowing together
and filling earth and heaven with their
united clamour. Bernard would let her loose
into the world, just as in days gone by he had
let loose on the moors that wild sow he had not
been able to tame. When Anne was at last
married, people might say what they liked: Bernard
would fling Thérèse into the depths of Paris
and then hurriedly retire; this was understood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
between them. There would be no divorce or
official separation; some reason of health would
be invented for the sake of appearances,—“She
is never well except when she is travelling.” And
Bernard would render, every All-Saints’ Day, an
exact account of the income from the sale of
her resin.</p>

<p>Bernard did not question Thérèse about her
plans, let her go and hang herself somewhere
else. “I shan’t have any peace,” he said to his
mother: “until she is off the premises.” And
she had replied: “I’ve no doubt she will take her
maiden name again ... however, if she gets
into trouble, you will be dragged into it fast
enough.” “But Thérèse,” he said, “only kicked
in harness; no one could be more sensible when
she had her freedom.” In any case, they must
take the risk. That was Monsieur Larroque’s
opinion also. All things considered, it was better
that Thérèse should disappear; she would be
more quickly forgotten, and people would get out
of the habit of talking about her. Silence was
the essential thing. This notion was so firmly
fixed in their minds that nothing could have uprooted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
it. They must get Thérèse out of harness;
and how impatient they were to do it!</p>

<p>Thérèse loved to watch the close of winter
despoiling the already barren land, though the
oaks had never shed their stubborn mantle of
dead leaves. She discovered that the silence of
Argelouse had no real existence. In the calmest
weather the forest moaned like a sorrowing human
soul, and lulled itself to sleep: and the
nights were full of a murmur that never ceased.
In her future life; that unimaginable life before
her, there would be dawns so barren that she
would perhaps regret the hour of awakening at
Argelouse: that marvellous clamour of myriad
cocks. She would remember, in the summers to
come, the grasshoppers by day and the crickets
by night. Paris: no longer the torn and battered
pines, but human beings to be feared: a world
of men, no longer a world of trees.</p>

<p>Husband and wife were astonished that their
relations were so little constrained. Thérèse reflected
that people become endurable as soon as
we are sure we can get away from them. Bernard
was interested in Thérèse’s <span class="lock">weight,—but</span> also in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
her conversation. She spoke more freely in his
company than she had ever done: “In Paris ...
when I am in Paris ...” she would begin: she
would live in a hotel and perhaps look for a flat.
She would take up a course of study, and go to
lectures and concerts; “begin her education all
over again.” Bernard never thought of watching
her, and ate his soup and drank his wine,
quite unconcerned. Doctor Pédemay, who sometimes
met them on the Argelouse road, said to
his wife: “What is so amazing is that they don’t
look as if they were acting.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a warm morning in March, about ten
o’clock, the stream of humanity had begun to
move, and was already surging against the Café
de la Paix outside which Bernard and Thérèse
were sitting. She threw away her cigarette, and
carefully stamped it out, as people from the
Landes always do.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid of setting fire to the pavement?”
Bernard laughed constrainedly. He
was annoyed with himself for having accompanied
Thérèse to Paris. As it was so soon after Anne’s
marriage he had, of course, done so out of deference
to public <span class="lock">opinion,—but</span> mainly because his
wife had wished it. He told himself she had a
positive flair for false situations: so long as she
remained in his life, he was always in danger of
being manœuvred into doing foolish things of
this kind; the wretched woman still had some
sort of influence even on a solid and self-respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
person like himself. At the very moment of
parting, he could not resist a feeling of sadness,
which he would never have admitted: nothing
could have been more foreign to his character
than an emotion of this kind, inspired by any one;
but inspired by Thérèse,—it was inconceivable.
He was so impatient to be rid of all disturbing
influences! He would not breathe freely until
he was in the train going South. The car would
meet him that evening at Langon: and on the
<a id="chg3"></a>Villandraut road, almost immediately outside the
station, the pines began. He watched Thérèse’s
profile, and her eyes that sometimes fixed upon a
face in the crowd and followed it until it disappeared;
and he said abruptly:</p>

<p>“Thérèse ... I wanted to ask you....”</p>

<p>He turned his eyes <span class="lock">away,—he</span> had never been
able to withstand her look, and went on hurriedly:
“I should like to know ... was it because
you hated me ... because you couldn’t
bear the sight of me?...”</p>

<p>He listened to his own words with amazement
and annoyance. Thérèse smiled, then looked at
him fixedly and gravely. At last! Bernard had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
asked a question, the very question that would
have been the first to come into Thérèse’s mind
had she been in his place. That confession, so
carefully prepared, in the victoria along the
Nizan road, and then in the little local train to
Saint Clair, that patient meditation in the darkness,
her efforts to reach the mainspring of her
act,—all that exhausting cross-examination of her
conscience, was perhaps on the point of bearing
fruit. She had, unconsciously, disturbed Bernard’s
peace of mind. She had confused him:
and now he was questioning her like some one
who is in doubt, and cannot see clearly. He was
less self-assured, and therefore more sympathetic.
Thérèse gazed at this unknown creature
with a kind, almost maternal expression. However,
she replied in a bantering tone:</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know it was to get your pines?
Yes, I wanted to be in sole possession of your
pines.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“If I ever did believe that, I don’t believe it
any more. Why did you do it? You might as
well tell me now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>Her eyes stared into vacancy: on that pavement,
on the bank of that stream of mud and
huddled human bodies, before taking the plunge
and joining in the struggle, or allowing herself
to sink beneath the surface, she saw a gleam like
the light of breaking dawn: she envisaged a return
to the sad and desolate <span class="lock">country,—a</span> whole
life passed in meditation and striving after perfection,
in the silence of Argelouse ... the adventure
of the soul, the quest for God.... A
Moorish vendor of carpets and glass necklaces
thought she was smiling at him, and came up to
her: and she said in the same bantering tone:</p>

<p>“I was going to answer: ‘I don’t know why I
did it’; but now I believe I do know. Perhaps
it was to see a look of uneasiness, curiosity, in
those eyes of yours: the expression I have noticed
in them for the last moment or two:—just to upset
your self-satisfaction, in fact!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you can’t be serious even now,” he
grumbled, in a tone which reminded Thérèse of
her honeymoon. “Do tell me: why did you?”</p>

<p>She smiled no more, and in her turn asked a
question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose a man like you, Bernard, always
knows why he does a thing?”</p>

<p>“Naturally ... why, of course ... at least,
I think so.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I should so have wished you to know
everything. If you only knew how I have tortured
myself to try and see clearly.... But,
you see, all the reasons I could have given <span class="lock">you,—the</span>
moment I had uttered them, they would have
seemed unconvincing....”</p>

<p>“But,” said Bernard, impatiently, “there must
have been a day when you made up your mind
... when you actually did the thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the day of the great fire at Mano.”</p>

<p>Their heads were close together, and they were
talking in low tones. As they sat there, at that
meeting of the Paris highways, under the soft
sunlight, and in a slightly chilly wind that smelt
of foreign tobacco, and stirred the red and yellow
awnings, it seemed so strange to recall that stifling
afternoon, the horizon dense with smoke, the
tarnished blue of the sky, the penetrating torch-like
odour that rises from burning pine-forests,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
her own drowsy heart in which the crime
began to take on the semblance of a purpose.</p>

<p>“This is how it happened: it was in the dining-room,
which was dark, as it always is at midday:
you were talking with your head slightly turned
towards Balion, forgetting to count the drops
that fell into your glass.” Thérèse was not looking
at Bernard, absorbed in her anxiety not to
omit the most trifling circumstances; but she
heard him laugh and turned towards him: Yes,
he was laughing in his stupid way: “No, what do
you take me for,” he said! He did not believe
her,—and indeed what she was saying was hardly
credible. He grinned, and she recognised the
old Bernard, full of self-confidence and worldly
wisdom. He had recovered himself and once
more she knew that she was lost.</p>

<p>“So the idea came to you,” he said jeeringly,
“just like that, all of a sudden, by the intervention
of the Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p>How he loathed himself for having questioned
Thérèse. It meant the loss of all the accumulated
contempt that he had heaped upon the wretched
woman. She was raising her head again! Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
had he yielded to that sudden longing to understand?
Just as if there was anything to understand
in these hysterical creatures. But he had
spoken without thinking....</p>

<p>“Listen, Bernard, I’m not telling you this to
persuade you of my innocence, far from it!”</p>

<p>Her self-accusation was full of a strange and
passionate sincerity: to have been able to act, as
she had done, in a kind of trance, for months
past, she must, she thought, have conceived and
brooded over thoughts of crime. Besides, when
once the deed was done, with what savage lucidity
of purpose and persistence she had pursued
her aim!</p>

<p>“I only felt cruel when my hand trembled.
I hated myself for prolonging your sufferings;
I felt I must bring the business to an end, and
quickly too! I obeyed a dreadful sense of <span class="lock">duty,—yes,</span>
it was almost like a duty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, these are phrases,” Bernard broke in.
“Just try and tell me, once and for all, what you
wanted: come, now!”</p>

<p>“What I wanted? Indeed it would be easier
to say what I did not want. I did not want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
play a part, move like an automaton, talk in
formulæ, be eternally false to a Thérèse who....
No, Bernard, it’s no use: you see how hard
I am trying to tell the truth. How is it that
everything I tell you rings so false?...”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud: the man in front of us
turned round just now.”</p>

<p>All Bernard wanted now was to get away: but
he knew the fantastic creature too well: hair-splitting
was a favourite occupation of hers.
Thérèse, too, realised that her companion, who
for one brief second had come near to her, had
again receded into the infinite distance. But
she persisted, called in the aid of her lovely smile,
and spoke with certain low and husky intonations
he had always liked.</p>

<p>“But now, Bernard, I feel clearly that the
Thérèse who stamps out her cigarette because a
spark will set the undergrowth on fire, the
Thérèse who liked to count the pines, and look
after her resin:—the Thérèse who was proud to
marry a Desqueyroux, to hold a place in one of
the best families of the district, glad at last to
settle down, as the phrase goes;—that Thérèse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
is as real as the other, and as alive: No, there was
no need to sacrifice her to the other.”</p>

<p>“What other?”</p>

<p>She did not know what to answer, and he
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“I must come back sometimes, I suppose, on
business ... and to see Marie,” she said.</p>

<p>“What business? I look after the Family
property. You will have your place at all the
official ceremonies at which, for the honour of
the Family and in Marie’s interests, we must be
seen together. In as large a Family as ours there
are often weddings, I am glad to say, and
funerals as well. I shall be surprised, for instance,
if Uncle Martin lasts until the autumn:
that will be an opportunity, since you seem to
be getting tired of your independence already.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A policeman on horseback came up with a
whistle at his lips, opened an invisible sluice,
and an army of pedestrians hurried across the
dark roadway before the wave of taxis submerged
them once more. “I ought to have gone out one
night,” she thought, “on to the great moors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
the South, like Daguerre: I ought to have walked
through the stunted pines of that evil <span class="lock">land,—walked</span>
until I was exhausted. I should not have
had the courage to keep my head under water
in one of the pools, as that Argelouse shepherd
did last year, because his daughter-in-law starved
him. But I could have lain down in the sand
and shut my eyes.... It is true the crows and
ants don’t wait until....”</p>

<p>She watched the stream of humanity, that living
mass, in which her body would so soon be
plunged and borne helpless away. She could do
nothing now. Bernard pulled out his watch
again.</p>

<p>“A quarter to eleven: just time to call at the
hotel....”</p>

<p>“You won’t be very warm travelling.”</p>

<p>“No, and I shall have to cover myself up this
evening in the car.”</p>

<p>She saw in her mind’s eye the speeding car,
and seemed to feel the cold wind that smells of
marshes, waste resin, burnt grass, mint, and mist.
She looked at Bernard and smiled that smile that
made the women of her country say in former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
days: “You can’t pretend she’s pretty, but then
she is so charming.” If Bernard had said: “I
forgive you; come ...” she would have got
up and followed him. But Bernard, after a momentary
feeling of irritation at his own emotion,
was now only conscious of his detestation of anything
odd, anything that departed from the daily
round of behaviour and conversation. Bernard
was made to fit the tracks, like his own carts; he
could not move outside the ruts: and only when
he had found them again, that very evening in
the dining-room at Saint Clair, would he find
peace and quiet once more.</p>

<p>“I want to ask your pardon for the last time,
Bernard.” She spoke with great earnestness and
with the intonation of <span class="lock">despair,—a</span> last effort to
reopen the conversation: “Say no more,” he protested.</p>

<p>“You will feel very lonely: though I am away,
there is still my empty place: it would have been
better for you if I had died.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders slightly, and in a
tone of something like joviality, begged her not
to worry herself about him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“Every generation of the Desqueyroux family
has had its old bachelor, and I was meant for
one of them. I have all the necessary <span class="lock">qualities—you’d</span>
be the last to deny that, wouldn’t you?
I am only sorry that we had a daughter, because
the family name will die out. It is true that
even if we had stayed together, we should not
have wanted another <span class="lock">child,—so</span> all is really for
the best. Don’t get up: stay where you are.”
He hailed a taxi, and came back to remind
Thérèse that he had paid for the drinks.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She stared for a long time at the dregs of port
at the bottom of Bernard’s glass; and then once
more began to watch the passers-by. A few
seemed to be walking up and down waiting for
someone. One woman turned back twice, and
smiled at Thérèse: she looked like a work girl,
or she was disguised as one. It was the hour
when the girls came out of the dressmakers’
shops. It did not occur to Thérèse to move: she
was perfectly content and not in the least depressed.
She decided not to go and see Jean
Azévédo that <span class="lock">afternoon,—and</span> heaved a sigh of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
relief: she did not want to see him. More <span class="lock">talk—more</span>
formulæ and phrases! She knew Jean
Azévédo; but those whose company she wanted,
she did not know: she was merely certain that
they would not insist on conversation. Thérèse
was no longer afraid of solitude. She was content
to remain silent and still: and just as, if her body
had been lying stretched out upon a heath in her
own country, ants and crows would have gathered
round it, so here she felt herself the centre of
some dark activity that eddied about her.</p>

<p>She felt hungry, got up, and saw her youthful
figure reflected in a tailor’s shop window: her
tightly fitting travelling-dress suited her admirably:
but her face, with its high cheek-bones and
peaked nose, still bore the dreadful traces of
those days at Argelouse. “I don’t look old,”
she thought. She lunched (as so often in her
dreams) in the Rue Royale. Why should she go
back to the hotel since she didn’t want to? A
warm feeling of satisfaction stole over her, thanks
to that half-bottle of Pouilly. She called for
cigarettes. A young man, sitting at the next
table, handed her his lighter, and she smiled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
To think that hardly an hour ago she wanted to
plunge, in Bernard’s company, into the dark Villandraut
road, between the rows of menacing
pines! She cared no more for one country than
another, pines or poplars, plain or ocean. Nothing
interested her except living creatures, beings
of blood and flesh. “It is not the stone-built city
that I love, nor lectures nor museums, but the
living forest that stirs within it, racked by passions
more furious than any storm. The lamentations
of the pines of Argelouse, at night, were
so strangely moving because they seemed so
nearly human.”</p>

<p>Thérèse had drunk a little and smoked a great
deal; and she smiled to herself like a woman who
at last is happy. She made up her cheeks and
her lips with great care: and then went out into
the <span class="lock">street,—to</span> seek what she might find.</p>
